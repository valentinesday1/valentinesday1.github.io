Sandy is John Herbert's grand-niece. When Chris Griffin shows up to collect the paper route money in "Valentine's Day in Quahog", Sandy falls for him but is too embarrassed to ask him out. Sandy gets Herbert's help in getting a date since he knows everything to say. As they have their date, Herbert stares from the bushes as Chris deep-throats a popsicle with Sandy. 
The opening to the episode is a parody on the trailer to the 2010 romantic-comedy film Valentine's Day. The pose in Meg's picture is a reference to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse photos. Glenn's becoming Glenda bears some similarities to the film Glen or Glenda about about cross-dressing and transsexuality.
