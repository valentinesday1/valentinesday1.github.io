The last time it fell on a Friday was in 2020, and you'll be pleased to know that next year, in 2026, the holiday will fall on a Saturday. The history of Valentine's Day

Valentine's Day 2025:Where to get heart-shaped pizza, doughnuts, nuggets and more food When is Valentine's Day? Valentine's Day is always on February 14th. In 2025, the holiday just so happens to  
In a 1981 academic article, the late University of Kansas English professor Jack B. Oruch argued that Chaucer's 1375 poem “Parlement of Foules” was the first to record St. Valentine's Day as a  
Valentine's Day (or Saint Valentine's Day) is observed on February 14 each year. It is celebrated in many countries around the world, mostly in the West, although it remains a working day in all of them unless if falls on a weekend. 
The holiday might have been created to be celebrated in mid-February to honor St. Valentine’s death or to help Christian leaders celebrate Lupercalia, a pagan fertility festival held on February  
Valentine's Day is celebrated on February 14. It is a festival of romantic love and many people give cards, letters, flowers or presents to their spouse or partner. They may also arrange a romantic meal in a restaurant or night in a hotel. 
In 496 A.D., Pope Gelasius marked February 14 as a day to honor their martyrdom, and a celebration of St. Valentine’s Day was born. In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church removed St. Valentine from the General Roman Calendar because of the lack of reliable information about him. 
Valentine’s Day celebrations have expanded to a week-long festival called Valentine’s Day Week in some countries like India. The week begins with Rose Day on February 7, followed by Propose Day (February 8), Chocolate Day (February 9), Teddy Day (February 10), Promise Day (February 11), Hug Day (February 12), and Kiss Day (February 13). 
Valentine's Day is upon us, and most romantics don't plan to let inflation ruin their holiday.. About 72% of people expect to spend more this Valentine's Day on Friday than they did in 2024  
Whether you take inspiration from the ideas above or put your own twist on things, remember: “Valentine’s Day is really about celebrating your love, your partner, your relationship, and your unique situation,” explains Leadingham. “It’s not about the price tag of a gift or going to the trendiest restaurant in town. 
One may believe that the stress associated with Valentine’s Day is part of the season’s excitement. But this is not entirely accurate. The Valentine’s Day experience may be much easier if you knew when and how to ask your crush or significant other to be your Valentine. 
With Valentine's Day approaching, you may not have all day to plan (or enjoy) an elaborate celebration, but there are plenty of low-effort, super-fun things to do on Valentine's Day that'll make the day special for you and your favorite people. Explore some V-Day ideas to get inspiration for your celebration.
