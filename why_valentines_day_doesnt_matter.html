        <p>Here are all the reasons why strong couples may not want to celebrate Valentine's Day, according to experts. 1. They Don’t Need To Flaunt Their Relationship Status. With TikTok 
This might bring some balance to Valentine’s Day, which still doesn’t have much going for it anyway. In China, there’s a holiday for single people called Singles’ Day , celebrated on Nov. 11, which isn’t ideal for obvious reasons in Canada, but it would be great if Canada adopted a similar holiday. 
If you're not feeling all bright and shiny about everything Cupid, then you're going to love these eight reasons why Valentine's Day is actually toxic AF, and why you're empowered to avoid it. 1. 
Celebrating this "holiday" is voluntary, no matter what Hallmark, 1-800-Flowers, or that heart-shaped Whitman's sampler box tells you. You can opt out at any time. In fact, there are plenty of 
Assistant professor of psychology, Dr. Laura VanderDrift, doesn't think celebrating Valentine's actually matters, but you should celebrate your relationships throughout the year. 
Are you dreading Valentine's Day? Here's the science of what makes us dislike it and what we can do to make ourselves happy this holiday (and every other day, too). 
An opinion piece on why celebrating commercialized Valentine's Day shouldn't be a big deal when it comes to your relationship. 
Valentine’s Day is the only holiday dedicated to celebrating a human emotion—love. While it is often associated with romance, it should be embraced as a broader celebration of love in all its  
One reason is because we may set unfairly high expectations for what Valentine’s Day should entail. This has only gotten worse with the advent of social media, where we can see influencers 
Cahleb Derry has spent only one Valentine’s Day with a romantic partner, and he has naturally dissociated the holiday from its romantic associations. “I think it’s so important to ‘date  
Tell him you do Valentine's Day, and it's important to you that he at least wish you a happy V-Day and accept your card. It doesn't matter that he doesn't see the day the same way that you do, it matters that he values the happiness the day brings you. 
Many people hate Valentine's Day because it reminds them of being single. To this I ask, why is Valentine's Day celebrated? It is to celebrate love. This doesn't necessarily mean romantic love. You can still celebrate the love of your family, your friends, and even yourself. If you feel sad and lonely on Valentine's Day, treat yourself. 
Why Valentines Day Doesn't Matter 
If Valentines day is at all important to him, then she should be making it a priority. And if Valentine's day is important to him, and her friend, then she should be giving him priority over her friend, (again, barring a particularly unusual circumstance). In this case, how the girlfriend feels about Valentine's day is irrelevant. 
100% this. Look after yourself - you obviously were looking forward to a "night off." You'll feel better if you do that for yourself - I'm not sure where you are and what your covid restrictions are, but even a takeaway coffee in a nice spot with a podcast or music or a book might do the job here. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
Just be yourself. Do what you can to make her happy. Sometimes, just staying by her side or listening to her is more than enough. I don't care about Valentine or holiday/special days in general, but maybe she does care. I guess she just wants to be with you and spend a special day together like many other cou 
Almost 19 years ago, I was born on Valentine’s Day, and ever since, my life has been guided by love. My actions, ideals, goals and hobbies have all been driven by love in some form. It all sounds like a cliche and maybe it is. However, this holiday has always compelled me to share as much love as  
There can be a lot of pressure on February 14, which is why the best solution may be to treat every day (or at least more days) as if it were Valentine’s Day. That doesn’t mean you have to go all out and buy extravagant gifts and go on fancy dates all the time; just that you show love and affection more often.
