        <p>If you have a good special someone to make it up to, you'll be surprised how many good traits, gift-givings, or memories you'll come up with. You can write down individual memories and put them in a decorative mason jar you make or write a long letter or list in a big Valentine's Day (or in this case, a "Sorry I screwed up Valentine's Day) card. 
It made me feel so terrible. It wasn't even a "oh that was so nice usually I hate Valentine's Day but thanks for the effort". Nope. she was excited for the gifts and everything for all of 5 minutes then back to being all grumpy. I really felt like I screwed up 
And NPR wants to hear about a Valentine's Day grand gesture, gift or surprise that did not go as you planned. Perhaps you bought an amazing gift. Maybe you planned a romantic getaway. 
With Valentine's Day coming up, men and women are scrambling to get their significant other the perfect gift. Much like the holiday season, it can be difficult to know exactly what to buy the  
By far, survey respondents said their most desired Valentine's Day was a sentimental gift, with 38% saying they preferred something like a homemade card or romantic experience — think picnic in  
Flowers and chocolates on Valentine's Day are fine — but sometimes you want to go bigger. Bigger, however, is not always better. And NPR wants to hear about a Valentine's Day grand gesture, gift  
Screwed up Valentine's Day gift I have developed a crush on a gorgeous girl at a shop nearby. I'm single and ready to mingle, so thought of gifting her a box of gift wrapped ferrero rocher chocolates on valentine's day. 
By the time we arrive at the restaurant(s), they are packed with Valentine's Day couples, and we end up at a dive at 8 p.m. eating buffet quality food. It really was a foreshadowing of our entire  
Worst Gifts To Give on Valentine's Day - Re-gifted Items Re-gifting can be a bit of a red flag, especially if you re-gift something that isn’t quite right for your partner. My friend once opened a box of chocolates, only to find a “Merry Christmas” card still tucked inside—it was obvious the gift was an afterthought. 
I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
Gift Idea #5.Get Her A Gift From The Kids. I got this suggestion from a reader named Chris, and it’s a great idea. This works especially well if you have young kids. 
It started with corny, little Valentine's cards you make for your classmates in elementary school. To full-fledged romantic dinners. Then eventually they got married on Valentine's day. We were freshly in the relationship, so I digressed, and agreed no Valentine's day. So, I never attempted to celebrate it again. That brings us to this  
was a valentines day gift I gave because our first date was at a sushi restaurant. I had two meaningful and silly messages engraved based on our memorable spontaneous share moments. The quality is great, the engraving professional, and every time you guys have sushi there is always a happy memory! 
Valentine's day came around and, although it wasn't my fault we weren't together, I ordered a gift of 3 dozen roses + candy and a stuffed animal. Day of, I got an alert from Fedex of a delayed shipment and panicked - it broke my heart to think she wouldn't get any flowers that day, so I called around to local florists and found one who could  
For our first Valentine's Day together I gave my then boyfriend a little hippo stuffed animal. It had funny eyebrows that reminded me of his. Fast forward 10 years later, and my husband says if our house was on fire he would run back in to save that hippo. Moral of the story: it doesn't have to be a big gift, just something you put thought into. 
12. Launch an exclusive sale on Valentine’s Day itself. While most shoppers are looking for gifts to give their loved ones on Valentine’s Day itself, who said all the fun has to stop when the big event rolls around? To keep the love going, think about running a sale on Valentine’s Day itself. 
In general, if you have to force someone to give a gift; there is an issue. So no, your DH shouldn't have to buy his mom a valentine's day gift. I definitely think of valentine's day as more of a cute holiday than anything else. I make cookies and cupcakes for my friends.

like someone said here, we dont really give gifts through the distance but in person. we both dont really mind it cause we value spending time more than gifts. we dont place too much expectations on holidays when we are diatant. just the fact that i was able to spend time with him and watch a show and call made my valentines day nice ☺ and  
Can Grandma or Grandpa spoil their grandchildren too much? You bet they can. It is always best for grandparents to check with their children before showering the grandchildren with too many or too extravagant gifts. Ask the grandchildren to provide you with reasonable wish lists. Of course, there are so many factors that play into this. </p>
