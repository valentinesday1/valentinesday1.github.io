        <h2><strong>when he didnt call for valentines day hardcore shows on valentines day pa ms</strong></h2>
        <p>I know, we're all done with Valentine's Day, but one reader has a little Vday hangover; the guy she's seeing, and had just slept with, didn't even call. By John Ortved February 16, 2011 
If your new partner doesn‚Äôt want to do something special for Valentine‚Äôs Day and you do, this suggests he‚Äôs just not that into you, or may signal important information about clashing values. Valentine‚Äôs Day, like many holidays, often tap into traditions and messages you‚Äôve internalized since early childhood. 
Third, let him know that Valentine's Day is important to you. Let him know that February 14th can be as important to a woman as the Super Bowl is to a man. That, he will understand. Not every woman likes Valentine's Day. Not every couple wants to celebrate on a day where the menu prices are escalated. It's a very personal and emotional day for  
Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
You didn‚Äôt mention if both of you still have ACTIVE dating profiles up or not. I have a feeling you probably do, as if you haven‚Äôt had the talk about exclusivity or Valentine‚Äôs, he might assume you‚Äôre dating other people and he might be doing the same. Believe it or not, most guys don‚Äôt like Valentine‚Äôs Day. 
Last year was our first Valentine‚Äôs Day together. He made a reservation (the only time he‚Äôs ever made the reservation), he picked me up, he walked me to the car that he specifically washed just for the date, he had two boxes of chocolate cause they didn‚Äôt have my favorite, and he held my hand the entire time and told me about all the  
You communicated with him your desire to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day and exchange gifts. You spent hours searching for the perfect thing to gift, and he didn‚Äôt give anything in return. Well, ignorance isn‚Äôt good enough as an excuse. I would cut him some slack if you didn‚Äôt talk about it in advance. 
These Are the Reasons He Didn‚Äôt Call You: He forgot. He‚Äôs insecure and afraid of rejection. He met someone else. He‚Äôs just a flirt. He doesn‚Äôt think you‚Äôre right for him. He‚Äôs taken. He asked for your number without really thinking if he wanted it. 
If he's cancelling on you once he's found out it's Valentine's Day, he doesn't sound like much of a stand up guy. This is exactly what I don't get. I'm a guy that doesn't really "do" Valentine's Day, either, but I sure as hell wouldn't let it stop me from going out on a date that I already arranged. 
46 votes, 18 comments. true. Certain men act like it‚Äôs really so hard to make Valentine‚Äôs Day special. 
Anyway, I don't expect him to give me anything for valentine's day even that I did make and give him a digital valentine's day card in which he didn't say much for that either üòù But we spent the whole night (his time), morning (my time) binge watching a series and talked till he fell asleep. 
My fianc√© didn't get me anything for V-Day for 15 years. This year, he surprised me with 2 gifts. The whole V-Day frenzy about "oh, you have to get your SO a gift or flowers or they'll be mad" is so frustrating. That's just a rant about you being mad that he didn't get you anything on *that* day. 
I know the way I put it sounds like I am being selfish but it‚Äôs the fact that he didn‚Äôt seem like he felt bad for not doing anything. Even if he had made me dinner or watched a movie with me I would feel better but he didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not trying to take it the hardest but he hasn‚Äôt done anything for Christmas or our 6 month. 
All right, it's the day after Valentine's Day and no, he didn't call and I think I'm OK with that for now. To answer all the other questions: No, we don't talk every day and he otherwise probably wouldn't have called me last night since it was a Thu night. 
I kinda trusted him to answer later, but he didn‚Äôt. Tomorrow is Valentines Day. I‚Äôm assuming we won‚Äôt be doing anything on Valentines Day and I won‚Äôt have a valentine, which feels kinda odd because it feels like we should be at that point where we could be each other‚Äôs valentine, but then I know he works all the time. 
One great technique for spoiling Valentine‚Äôs Day. As well as playing No Talkies in a restaurant, he loved to pull The Valentine‚Äôs Card Number. Before the pre-Valentine‚Äôs Day fight, he would go into a card shop and buy a Valentine‚Äôs card. He would make sure I saw the bag it came it. 
He spend more than $1k for "the day". After dinner, she was like "I can't wait to see my present" and got mad because "The Day" didn't counted as a present. Maybe your gf saw what you did as not "presents" and decided that your relationship "don't do" gifts for celebration. 
February 14 is the most romantic of days and, in spite of its importance, your boyfriend forgot Valentine ‚Äò s day, didn ‚Äò t he? Instead of waking you up to chocolate or flowers or words of affirmation or a nice brunch out, did your boyfriend jump out of bed, kiss you quickly and head out for a run, returning with bagels and a paper and not a word about what day it was. 
I didn't think it was stressful to just text someone "Happy Valentine's Day." Not to be rude, but it's something I also say to my family and friends, and at the very least, he and I are friends. We've been friendly to each other. He started the conversation for the day, so I figured it would have been nice for him to just wish me a happy holiday. 
I never understood valentines day. Its literally a commercial holiday ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Birthdays are special, anniversaries are specifical*, your chosen religious holidays are special. Valentines day is literally just a day where shops etc can massively jack up their prices. </p>
