The 41 Best Valentine's Day Gifts for Men That Go the Extra Mile From our favorite boxers to the best electric razor out there. By Mark Stock Published: Jan 31, 2025 9:25 AM EST 
I think with Valentine's Day its better to lean into their interests. You can make most things related to cheesy romance / Valentine's Day with the right puns or packaging. My husband likes ropes and tying knots. I got him The Ashley Book of Knots, wrapped the book, and tied long lengths of folded paracord into a bow. 
What do you mean if guys actually care about valentines day? Valentines day is to celebrate love, but only guys are buying flowers, chocolate, planning something nice and romantic and not getting anything. Valentines day should be renamed into “girlfriend day” Doesn’t mean you have to get him flowers or chocolate, but something symbolic. 
My girlfriend wanted to do this for Valentine's Day, then a couple of days later she told me she was only pity dating me. So I went home and talked to my friend over text about everything and she asked me to be her Valentine. She's at a school 5 hours away so we're going to Skype and have a dinner date. Everything went better than expected. 
What Do Men Really Want For Valentine’s Day? For many centuries now people have been sending cards with sweet messages inside on February 14th to those they care about most using various languages like English or Spanish! 
Something that tells them you really know them: “I feel like once you’re in a relationship for a couple of years, at least for me, what I love in a Valentine’s Day gift is a nod that you realllllyyyy know that person. You know what interests them in a book, their favorite color of wrapping paper, the types of clothes they like to wear  
So guys, tell us what gifts you actually like getting for Valentine's Day (and why they're so perfect). Your answer could be featured in an upcoming BuzzFeed Community post or video. Tap to play GIF 
2.4K votes, 3.4K comments. true. Exactly, I like being romantic and cooking dinner and getting her flowers, I hate having a day where I feel obligated to get gifts and do all of that or go out to a fancy dinner, it's a huge marketing day for cards and heart shaped jewelry and it's bullshit. 
For Valentine’s day this year, I ordered one of those art pieces from Etsy that will take maps of locations you pick, cut the images into cute shapes, and make a picture (like a mountain range) out of them, so he can see all our memories arranged nicely. 
Men really want valentine's Day to fuck off  I treat my SO like a queen every day and do not need an expensive over commercialised bull shit fabrication to remind me to make a fuss of the most important person in my life .. plus I get sex when ever I want . </p>
