Sure, Valentine’s Day is typically associated with couples, but in this day and age, it is also a day to admire love in all forms—the most important of which is self-love. 
Not to take the romance out of Valentine's Day, but you probably won't get a better gift than the one you can give yourself. Where is the lie?! Whether you've been with your S.O. for 50 years, five da

Let’s be honest. Valentine’s Day is anxiety-inducing, regardless of your status — a long-term relationship, fresh from a breakup, in a shitty situationship, or single.

This Valentine’s Day, give yourself complete permission to indulge without hesitation and without feeling like you have to earn it. Here are a couple ways to indulge and show yourself some love  
how to treat yourself this valentine’s day. Gift yourself a monthly plant subscription from The Sill! Not ready for the commitment?

I think with Valentine's Day its better to lean into their interests. You can make most things related to cheesy romance / Valentine's Day with the right puns or packaging.
