        <p>A whopping 83% of flowers purchased for Valentine’s in 2022 were roses, according to the Society of American Florists — and about two-thirds were specifically of the red variety. 
It is estimated that more than 250 million roses are produced for Valentine’s Day. (Based on consumer purchases of fresh flowers and plants for holidays at all outlets.) Valentine’s Day is the number one holiday for florists and for floral purchases, and second to Christmas/Chanukah in dollars spent. Who’s buying for Valentine’s Day? 
At other times of the year, flowers are typically brought into the country by plane seven times a day, six days a week. But just before Valentine’s Day, those numbers leap. In the two weeks leading up to February 14, there are more than 14 flights of flowers a day, seven days a week. 
Nearly 250 million roses are grown in preparation for Valentine's Day each year. We take red roses for granted as a Valentine’s Day staple. But roses actually don’t grow in February weather in

Seventy-eight percent of the flowers consumers purchase for Valentine’s Day are cut flowers, with men being the top customers. Most of them are buying long-stemmed roses as gifts for their wives or significant others, according to a 2005 Ipsos-Insight Floral Trends Consumer Tracking Study. 
Customers spent $2.3 billion on flowers for Valentine’s Day in 2022, also the highest amount since 2007 (tied with 2020). As for the most popular flower, it will come as no surprise: red roses account for 70% of all Valentine’s Day flower purchases.
