Valentine’s Day is a wonderful time to rekindle passion. But what about the other 364 days of the year? Here are a few things I have learned, both personally and professionally, that help spark romance all year round: Play offense. Don’t wait until your spouse loses his or her cool because you’re not thoughtful or romantic enough. Think

They’re opportunities to pause and show love to each other in ways that aren’t always feasible in the day to day. Sometimes plans go awry or don’t make the impact you’d imagined. One Valentine’s Day, we took an early dinner reservation just so we could try a new restaurant — and we were the youngest guests by at least 30 years. 
Ephesians 5:25-28: “Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. 
Here’s how you can make Valentine’s Day special—and invest in your relationship all year long! If you’ve been married for a while, it’s possible that Valentine’s Day has lost some of its luster.

2. Print your valentines (in color, please). 3. Cut out each card along the dotted lines. 4. Fold the valentine in half and secure with glue or tape. 5. Sign the back of the card and give it to a friend or classmate on Valentine’s Day! 
And sure, February 14 is over-commercialized, with red, heart-shaped boxes of chocolates and giant teddy bears in every store. And the internet is cluttered with all sorts of Valentine’s Day gift ideas. But Valentine’s Day can also be a great excuse to shower your spouse with things that make him or her feel loved. 
It was Valentine’s Day 1996. I was a single mom with three little boys. My heart ached because my husband was celebrating with another woman. I felt rejected and miserable. After my children were bathed and put to bed, I sat down with my Bible and a cup of tea. The snow covering the ground outside shimmered under the moon’s glow.
