        <h2><strong>hungarian valentines day traditions couples robes valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Saint Valentine’s Day in Hungary is called Valentin Nap or Bálint-nap. After the execution of Valentinus (Saint Bálint in Hungary), he became a saint in the 5 th century and the protector of lovers, married couples, engaged couples, neurotics, and epileptics.

In Hungary, Christians celebrate St. Valentine’s Day on February 14th every year. Like with most European countries, Hungarians give flowers, cards and chocolates to their loved ones. 
Chocolate gifting became a Valentine’s Day staple thanks to Richard Cadbury’s invention of the heart-shaped chocolate box in the 1800s. Today, chocolates are one of the top gifts exchanged on Valentine’s Day, with everything from fancy truffles to giant chocolate bars making their way into hearts and hands. 
In a 1981 academic article, the late University of Kansas English professor Jack B. Oruch argued that Chaucer's 1375 poem “Parlement of Foules” was the first to record St. Valentine's Day as a  
Each year on February 14th, people exchange cards, candy, gifts or flowers with their special “valentine.” The day of romance we call Valentine’s Day is named for a Christian martyr and dates back to the 5th century, but has its origins in the Roman holiday Lupercalia.
