        <h2><strong>what is valentines day mean to christians top things to do in orlando for valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Nevertheless, Valentine’s Day is connected to Christianity, but not solely. Valentine’s Day began as Saint Valentine’s Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine. The feast was first established by Pope Gelasius I to honor one or two saints named Valentinus for being martyred on February 14. 
Most of us enjoy "spoiling" a loved one on Valentine’s Day. Sending gifts and cards conveys love, affection, and friendship. There is no biblical reason why Christians should not celebrate Valentine’s Day by giving their loved ones flowers, candy and/or cards. 
So what should Christians make of today’s Valentine’s Day? As much as purely possible! Valentine was a saint and Eros is not Cupid’s domain. It’s God’s! Christians should be the most unashamed, exuberant celebrators of romantic love there are, and the strongest guardians of God’s design and boundaries, because God made it for us to  
Valentine’s Day, every February 14 th, involves hugs and kisses, the sending of millions of romantic greeting cards, the giving of roses and other flowers, and the mass consumption of chocolates and additional candies. What is the history of this holiday? Should Christians get involved with it? ORIGIN OF VALENTINE’S DAY. Who exactly was  
Nevertheless, Valentine’s Day is connected to Christianity, but not solely. What Does This Mean? Whatever Valentine’s Day means to you, it is for you to decide. I think it’s a great opportunity to celebrate love, whether it be for family, friends, lovers, or neighbors because Jesus said that people would know us by our love. 
While the world emphasizes romance only, we can use this day to celebrate God’s love, the love of family and friends, and the faith that binds us together. St. Valentine was a Christian priest devoted to God, steadfast in his faith, and willing to stand against injustice for the sake of his beliefs. 
On February 14 millions of people exchange tokens and messages of love and affection. Where and how did the curious customs of Valentine's Day begin? Does God have anything to say about such practices? 
So, it is likely that there is at least some truth in the idea that Valentine’s Day is based on a Catholic martyr named Valentine. The problem is that the Catholic Church recognizes at least 
St. Valentine's Day, celebrated annually on February 14th, is a day dedicated to love and affection. While commonly associated with the exchange of romantic gestures and tokens of love, the origins of this widely celebrated day are rooted in a rich history that includes the Christian religion. 
Valentine's Day, widely celebrated as a day of love and romance, has deep Christian roots that often go overlooked amidst the chocolates and flowers. While it has evolved into a cultural, religious, and commercial celebration, its Christian origin can offer profound insights. 
Bible Verses About Valentine’S Day The Nature of Love. As we embrace Valentine’s Day, we get a beautiful reminder of the importance of love in our lives. This love isn’t just about romance; it extends to all kinds of relationships we cherish. The Bible teaches that love is patient and kind, emphasizing how we should treat one another daily. 
Because of the heavy commercialization of Valentine’s Day, a lot of women developed unrealistic expectations. They think that they DESERVE something during Valentine’s Day. If they don’t get something, they feel sad, frustrated, and disappointed. Not only that, but Valentine’s Day promotes the wrong kind of love. 
Most sources believe that Saint Valentine’s Day began with a feast in honor of an early Christian martyr named Valentinus and is celebrated in mid-February to coincide with his burial. Some believe it may also be celebrated at this time in an effort to Christianize the pagan Roman celebration of Lupercalia – a fertility festival related to

Popular Gifts Given During Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day is a special occasion when people express their love and affection for each other by exchanging gifts. 
Do a Valentine’s Day Bible Reading Challenge: Read passages about God’s love (e.g., Romans 5:8, Ephesians 5:25-33) and discuss how to apply them. Plan a Day of “Random Acts of Kindness”: Commit to doing small acts of love for each other or those around you. This Valentine’s Day, let’s not just celebrate love but live it. 
The best way to celebrate Valentine is to remember the love of God. The Bible says, ‘for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son’ It is a time of giving. Unfortunately
