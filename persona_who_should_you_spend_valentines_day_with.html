        <h2><strong>persona who should you spend valentines day with good conversations for valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>People like you are only confusing others. Valentine's chocolate doesn't help with their confidant ranks, It's the Christmas present that does so and you don't have to date only one of them to get chocolate from one of them. You will get to choose with whom you spend valentine's with. ^He's right y'know. 
I always pick Yukiko. There’s something fun about her in the english dub that makes me choose her over the other girls. I always thought she was the less popular girl from P4, I’m glad I’m not the only one who picks her. 
On my playthrough, in which I dated Makoto, the normal dialogue plays during the date on White Day. When I went to search this same scene on Youtube, I watched a compilation video that had everyone. When dating Makoto in that video on White Day, she mentions how she doubted you based on the shenanigans you pulled on Valentine's Day. 
After a nice day with your friends, you can choose who you wish to spend Valentine's Day with via any texts you'll receive at night. Hopefully, you didn't romance multiple characters because you  
The heart of Persona 3 Reload is still about you finding out the festering truth about Tartarus, the Dark Hour, and the shadows. But P3R reminds you that no journey is complete without the friends you make along the way. And for some of the romance options in ATLUS’ remaster of the beloved RPG, you can be a little more than friends. 
Still, A Magical Valentine’s Day plays devil’s advocate and is broken up into eleven separate chapters where Ren gets to spend some time with every character. Does romance do anything Persona 5? Accepted Answer. If you romance you’re able to spend valentines day and christmas with that person. 
I believe you get chocolate from whoever you spend Valentine's day with. It's the 15th where all your side chicks come to attack you. I had a harem and spent Valentine's day with Ryuji because I wasn't giving any of my hoes preferential treatment on my first playthrough. 
The girls you reach Rank 10 with, but don't romance will also give you a different consumable (giri-choco). If you cheated on anyone (or spent time with the boys) the girl(s) will turn up the day after and beat you up. You won't receive their Valentines chocolate, but you get chocolate from Sojiro, who smooths things over with the angry girls. 
In P3P at least there's a Christmas thing. I played as a girl though, so I'm unsure if the same thing happens when you play as a guy. However Valentines Day doesn't happen because the game ends before then. 
Tonight you will get a call from everyone you had a romantic relationship with. Choose one to spend Valentine's Day with. February 14th. Valentine's Day is today! Spend it with a girl you're in a  
I think you'll only see Valentine's Day with her if you're her lover, I don't think she shows up on that day if you're platonic friends. She does show up if you're platonic friends, with chocolate too. Aside from her saying she loves you, it's still the same, right down to the "If you don't eat it, it'll melt. If it melts, it'll run away." 
You can date Marie and the non party member girls like Yumi/Ayane and Ai without consequences as long as you spend Valentines with the party member. However, for the party member girls, if you date one of them and say Ai, and you choose to spend Valentines day with Ai, you will get the sad scene on Valentines day where you have to reject your  
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance, love, Saint Valentine - and gifts. Americans in relationships plan to spend an average of $155 on Valentine's Day this year and Gen Z leads the pack  
Still, A Magical Valentine’s Day plays devil’s advocate and is broken up into eleven separate chapters where Ren gets to spend some time with every character. Does romance do anything Persona 5? Accepted Answer. If you romance you’re able to spend valentines day and christmas with that person. 
“I can’t even spend time with my boyfriend on valentine’s day” Granted, Chie’s is easily the most heartbreaking. When she says “I won’t ask you where you’re going or who you’re with. I believe in you.” that shit HURT. 
Subreddit Community for Persona 5 and other P5/Persona products! Please be courteous and mark any and all spoilers. Persona 5 is a role-playing game by ATLUS in which players live out a year in the life of a high school boy who gains the ability to summon facets of his psyche, known as Personas. 
You may not be in love with Marie, but she is in love with you That said, she does respect boundaries if you didn’t romance her. So, her chocolate was a friendship chocolate, she only hugged you rather than anything further, and you were only chatting. She and Rise are very similar that way, as Rise always declares her love even if you don’t romance her, but in a way 
Theres really nothing special to do. Just romance at least one girl and you will be asked if you want to spend valentines day with them. Its not tied to any specific ending because the ending decision points happen well after valentines day. 
For White Day you must pick one of the girls you romanced, or you automatically take your girl if you only have one. Sojibro will have sorted out any lingering ill will from Valentines if you had any issues, so any girl you blew off there is available for White Day, you don't have to take the Valentine's Day girl. 
In Royal this will still happen but you can also choose to spend White Day with a girl, if you choose a different girl from Valentine’s Day they will take it as an apology and make up with you. During the date you will get a call from the girl you spent Valentine’s with but will automatically decline the call. </p>
