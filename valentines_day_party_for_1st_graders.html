For class parties I love to set up four activity stations. Valentine's Day parties are much easier when kids are in small groups versus all doing the same thing at the same time. Here are the four Valentine's Day party stations I typically set up: Valentines themed Arts &amp; Crafts; Valentine's Day Games; Valentine's Day Bingo; Valentines themed Snack 
Valentine’s Day is in the horizon again, so it’s officially time to plan for the Valentine’s Day Party!!! 🙂. Here are four simple games that are best done as stations with a parent to help at each station as students rotate around the classroom! With each game lasting around 5 minutes, it will take the kids 20 minutes total to complete! 
Here’s a fun Valentine’s Day game that will reinforce literacy skills too. Here’s how it works: Students will learn that 8 people were at a Valentine’s Day party when two people were struck by cupids bow and fell in love. They’ll then need to solve who is cupid. Students will get 8 Valentine’s day non-fiction riddles to solve. 
To make it more challenging, set up obstacles like chairs or cones. The first team to finish wins a Valentine’s-themed prize. Valentine’s Day Charades Play a round of Valentine’s-themed charades using phrases like “writing a love letter,” “first date,” or “getting a Valentine’s Day gift.” 
1st and 2nd Grade Valentine’s Day Activities. Your first or second grade classroom is full of students who want to be your valentine. So make them happy and keep them busy with Valentine’s Day theme activities across all of the content areas. Students see just a hint of a holiday decoration and their attention is gone. 
Love and Science - Valentine’s Day is the perfect opportunity to try a few cool science experiments. Grow crystals, create slime or make a love potion. Now that’s chemistry! Heart Smart - Learn about this miraculous muscle and how to keep it healthy. Using a stethoscope, have kids measure their heart rate while at rest and after activity.
