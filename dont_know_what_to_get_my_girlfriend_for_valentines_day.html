So I (23M) have been in a relationship with my current girlfriend(22F) for about 6 months. I know most of her friends and they're all fine, I don't hate her best friend(21F), but she gets a little annoying. Valentines day topic comes up and my gf says she is excited for this year because her friend always gives gifts for valentines day. 
Yeah I told my boyfriend the same thing, but then again last year on valentines day. well it was just the worst day I've lived so far turned me off to valentines day. Plus my boyfriend shouldn't have to feel like he has to pay for a bunch of shit we can do any damn day of the year. 
A lot of ppl don’t take Valentine’s Day too serious, and also remember you guys are a new couple. She probably didn’t have too high expectations anyways. I’d say wait till your birthday to decide on how you really feel about this. Like Valentine’s Day is for the ladies.

Roses and chocolates are like soulmate in Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day is not a Valentine’s Day if there is no roses and chocolate. Make it more meaningful by giving your crush your own homemade chocolate. Giving them a box of chocolate spelled I LIKE YOU or their name would be great. Love Letter! 
Here are some beautiful Heartfelt Valentine’s Day words for your boyfriend to make him smile: 1. Every time you smile, it feels like I’m falling all over again. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. 2. Baby, one of the many goals in my life is to make you smile every second of life. Happy Valentine’s Day, My sunshine. 3. 
Not a holiday like Valentine's day. It's too specific to one person in your life. Most holidays aren't like that. Plus you could unintentionally make the person feel BAD about not having anyone to celebrate that day with. I don't see any good reason to ask unless you like them 
For Valentine’s Day my wife and I spam each other with the cheesiest and most messed up valentines memes we can find. That’s it. That’s all. You probably thought you sounded selfish because getting upset over not getting a gift is childish, greedy and plainly said your pushing your expectations on him for that day isn’t fair either. </p>
