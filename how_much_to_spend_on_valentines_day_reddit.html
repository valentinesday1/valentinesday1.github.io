        <h2><strong>how much to spend on valentines day reddit valentines day gift ideas for a new guy</strong></h2>
        <p>I haven't given it that much thought to be honest. My birthday is the day before and we pretty much have a standing "date night" every Friday so we'd be going out even if it wasn't Valentine's Day. I'll buy her flowers, we'll go out to dinner, and I'll probably pick up jewelry or something. All in, I'll probably spend somewhere around $500. 
Well under $20. I spend several dollars on my husband because we just like to exchange cards. Then I usually pick up a box of kids‚Äô valentines and some small boxes of chocolates. Any of my friends who don‚Äôt have an SO get a valentine and chocolates from me. 
30 dollars for coffee, a pan, a chocolate syrup and a huge cabbage, all that have nothing to do with valentine

Most expensive date may have been our Valentine‚Äôs Day date on Friday. My husband spent a little over $400 before the tip on a multi course meal at a very lovely steak house. He pays for 99% of our dates. The most I spent was probably $150 on dinner years ago- we like our steak houses! Cheapest- free! We often do walks or puzzles at home 
I'm an editor at AskMen.com and we're putting together an article now about how much a guy should spend on a Valentine's Day gift. We all know there's no black and white answer -- it totally depends on the girl (maybe she's not into this Hallmark holiday), how long you've been together and the stage of your relationship (i.e. new relationship  
In my mind everyday should be Valentine's Day, not just one single day where you blow all this money to show how much you love someone. Edit: the $200 2 dozen roses includes a nice vase, several lillies, baby's breath, greenery etc. Not just roses. I just think it's too much to be spending on flowersüôÉ 
Hello! Im an at home small floral business/llc on the side and I usually take order requests for birthdays/special occasions (bouquets and arrangements) and don‚Äôt do any events or weddings but I was thinking of taking maybe a few orders for valentine‚Äôs day 2025- possibly 5-10 orders for bouquets as i‚Äôm not quite sure how many people are willing to place an order with me. 
Yep pretty much the same and our Bunnings also hands out free rose stem to partners/wives. Source: my husband takes me every year on Valentine's Day to Bunnings ü§£ü§£ win/win. 
IMO Valentine‚Äôs Day is a day to show the people you care about how much you love them. My mum was in an abusive relationship and only 4 years ago did they get a divorce. She never received flowers or chocolates or any sort of romantic gesture / gifts. 
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance, love, Saint Valentine - and gifts. Americans in relationships plan to spend an average of $155 on Valentine's Day this year and Gen Z leads the pack  
Experience wise, this pretty much sums up why my wife and I usually avoid going out on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Good restaurants that we go to other days will switch to a fixed menu ‚Äúbuffet style‚Äù I.e. every things cooked in batches. At the same time the price also goes up, while quality and choice goes down. </p>
