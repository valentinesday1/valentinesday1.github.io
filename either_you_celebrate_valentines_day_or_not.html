        <p>READ MORE: How to Make a X-Box Valentine's Box. So, where did this day of love begin? There are conflicting stories on the exact origins of Valentine's Day. In fact, it wasn't even a day people celebrated until some time in the 14th century. Easy to remember since it falls on February 14th. 
Some U.S. adults consider Valentine's Day outdated, according to a new AP-NORC poll — but many more say they love the romance and fun of quality time with partners, friends and extended family. 
Many Americans see Valentine’s Day as a romantic and fun occasion. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say “romantic” describes Valentine’s Day “extremely” or “very” well, while about one  
“For many [Valentine’s Day] is a lonely time,” said Lila Killian, student at LRHS. Not only is Valentine’s Day a lonely time for many people, but it is often also seen as unnecessary. “I believe that people should not just show their love and affection to their loved ones only once a year, but everyday,” said Monique Dacanay  
Here’s your Valentine’s Day streaming list, no matter how you feel about Valentine’s Day. To be truly climate-conscious, you should skip the winter flower bouquet. 
Key points. Valentine’s Day celebrates all forms of love—romantic, familial, and platonic—not just romance. Its origins stem from ancient Roman festivals and Christian traditions honoring St  
You’d think that a day to celebrate romance would be fun for most people, but Valentine’s Day can be stressful for some couples because they feel that the day demands demonstration of the depth of romantic feelings. That’s a lot to ask of one specific day, especially if you happen to be busy at work, or going through something in the  
Love is in the air, and also must be in your wallet. Valentine’s Day is expensive, puts unnecessary pressure on relationships and takes away from the fact that we should show love and appreciation every day, not just on Feb. 14. For those who choose to celebrate Valentine’s Day, it can often be incredibly expensive. 
On Valentine’s Day it will offer live airbrushing and a balloon artist, in addition to a D.J.; it could be the setting for a date, but it’s intended as a broader celebration of love in all its  
Also, a single day should not make or break a relationship. Valentine’s Day should be a day to celebrate the people you care about, and the people should be more important than the day or the products that come with it. Raising expectations sky-high for a Valentine’s Day date is only going to mean disappointment. 
Valentine’s Day is a great opportunity to teach children about love—not just the typical romantic love you would expect to celebrate on Valentine’s Day, but the eternal love God has for all of us. This year, make the celebration even more meaningful with our printable Christian valentine cards. 
For us, Valentine's Day is a "light" holiday. Like, I don't go all out for VDay for my husband like for Christmas. I maybe get him some chocolate, make sure to tell him happy Valentine's Day. Make him a nicer-than-usual dinner. He will likely forget that it's Valentine's Day until I mention it. He is a kind person, but he's a tad bit forgetful. 
I have a set of three reading passages about Valentine’s Day. The reading passages are written for 2nd-4th grade students and include comprehension activities. One of the reading passages is about how people celebrate Valentine’s Day worldwide. Read more about the Valentine’s Day Reading Passages or purchase them via the links below. 
Valentine’s Day can be tough if you’re single, but it doesn’t always have to be about celebrating a significant other. “Valentine’s Day isn’t just a day to celebrate relationships. 
If Valentine’s Day isn’t important to either of you, why not focus on celebrating your anniversary instead? Love should be celebrated every day, not just once a year. If skipping isn’t an option, consider postponing the celebration. February 15 th — when Valentine’s Day chocolate and gifts go on sale, might be the perfect day to  
If he's cancelling on you once he's found out it's Valentine's Day, he doesn't sound like much of a stand up guy. This is exactly what I don't get. I'm a guy that doesn't really "do" Valentine's Day, either, but I sure as hell wouldn't let it stop me from going out on a date that I already arranged. 
So Valentine’s Day is coming up and I’m obviously in a relationship. But in my past relationships Valentine’s Day was never acknowledged or celebrated in an “aweeee ️” way. So now that Valentine’s Day is coming I just don’t want to celebrate it at all, I told my boyfriend that I just want to act like it’s a regular day. 
Landing on Friday, Feb. 14 this year, it’s time to celebrate Valentine’s Day. There are a whole host of bars and restaurants ready, willing, and able to roll out the red carpet for romantic couples celebrating their affection on this special day. Here are just a few choices along the 
Yes, we do, but not because it's Valentine's Day. I first set eyes on my husband on Feb. 14th, and that's my day to be romantic to him. I never just buy a gift though. One year I sent him a dozen text roses throughout the day. 
People in a relationship are much more likely than those not in a relationship to say they’ll celebrate Valentine’s Day in some way. Joseph Brubaker, a 38-year-old high school teacher from  </p>
