        <h2><strong>my husband did nothing for valentines day valentines day presents for new couples</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
Valentines days in the past he’s typically gotten me at least flowers, either made dinner at home or written a card. This year he literally said happy Valentine’s Day in the morning and the nothing all day long. Once bedtime came, still nothing. We’ve been together 11 years, married 6. 
My husband and I normally don’t do anything for Valentine’s Day but he used to get me flowers/food etc when we were dating. It wasn’t much, and I honestly didn’t care. But somehow this year, both of us have gotten busy and my husband (who was shitty before about planning romantic things) just 100% dropped the ball- no planning dinners  
Most of the time, my husband recognizes me on Valentine’s Day. But that year, I woke up to nothing. Not a card, not a flower, petal not even a piece of candy. I was hurt. I was disappointed. I  
I kept talking about it, reminding him and telling him how excited I was cause it was our first Valentine’s Day with our newborn. I got personalized desserts for him and I haven’t been working, but I got him a card. He got me absolutely nothing not even a card, was just going to eat the food I made and didn’t even say Happy Valentine’s Day. 
He would rather do nothing than risk disappointing me. Yes, I still feel a twinge of sadness when Valentine’s Day, my birthday, Mother’s Day, and Christmas come and go gift-free. I have to actively resist the urge to compare “my husband” to “her husband” as the photos go live on Facebook and Twitter. But then I remember that 
Consider the first Valentine's Day of our marriage.I awoke with a flurry of expectation. I was ready. Ready for my husband to stun me with his love and creativity. 
“Just confessed to my husband that I actually do care about Valentine’s Day and I’ve been running a pick-me long con for 16 years pretending I was super chill and didn’t care,” she wrote. In a follow-up essay on her blog , the author explained that this conversation wasn’t some big, drawn-out argument, but more of a “mild chuckle  
I’m in a similar situation my partner of 4 years did absolutely nothing for me yesterday (Valentine’s day) and I made it clear that I was upset and every time that he asked me what was wrong I clearly told him that I was upset that for the second year in a row he did absolutely nothing for Valentine’s Day. 
My husband didn’t do anything for Valentine’s Day. We usually exchange cards and presents but he did nothing this year. I even reminded him this morning telling him I have your present I just have to write your card. &amp;nbsp;He came home with nothing, not even a card. &amp;nbsp;What would you do? 
I don’t plan my own birthday, and this past birthday he hasn’t planned anything for it, which is why I tried to explain/ask for a plan for Valentine’s Day. I thought if I made my wants known this time, it would happen, especially considering I said it didn’t have to be expensive or an item, just a plan to be thought of. 
If he's cancelling on you once he's found out it's Valentine's Day, he doesn't sound like much of a stand up guy. This is exactly what I don't get. I'm a guy that doesn't really "do" Valentine's Day, either, but I sure as hell wouldn't let it stop me from going out on a date that I already arranged. 
Anyway, my husband did nothing for Valentine's day. He didn't forget, he just didn't do anything. I did get him presents that he seemed pumped about, he in fact got them a couple of days ago (they were items that I knew he could use last night at a guys night out kinda thing, that's why he got his presents early.) 
My husband skipped my birthday and wants to make up for it but I feel like the day has passed and it’s not at all the same. So I kind of don’t want to do anything now that he did nothing for my birthday at all. Didn’t get me anything or even a cupcake. I just turned 30 and no one in my life acknowledged it. My mom didn’t even call me. 
I haven't got my GF anything for the three valentines we've been together and she hasn't done anything for me either. Valentine day is a pointless day in the first place. You don't need a special day to let your SO know you care about them. 
I have told my husband that I get tired of planning our getaways and dinners. For my last birthday, he chose a lovely restaurant. We are renewing our vows in a couple of years and my husband is more vocal about preferences for that event. Tell your husband how you feel and what you want. 
Our dating anniversary is valentines (I invited a bunch of friends over for a friendshiptines day and only my now husband showed up) and then he proposed a year later on valentines as well. So valentines is special for us because of our history, not the holiday itself. 
My husband and I very minimally recognize valentine's day with each other, although we do give our daughter a little something each year. Our anniversary is in February and we get each other small gifts then. I've never been big on valentine's day, he thinks it's over commercialized and overpriced, and some years we don't recognize it at all. </p>
