Closer Online's Kayleigh Dray thinks we need to forget about presents on Valentine's Day - and focus on, y'know, the love part. Ah, Valentine's Day - it rolls around each and every year, bringing with it novelty teddy-bears, heart-shaped knick-knacks, lurid pink everything, and hundreds of almost identical photos on Facebook. 
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you.

You’d think that a day to celebrate romance would be fun for most people, but Valentine’s Day can be stressful for some couples because they feel that the day demands demonstration of the depth of romantic feelings. That’s a lot to ask of one specific day, especially if you happen to be busy at work, or going through something in the  
Valentine’s Day has traditionally been a day when men gift the special woman in their life something sweet. However, times have changed, and modern culture says that gifts are for everyone. So, do men expect Valentine’s Day gifts too? 
First off, "Happy Valentine's Day" can mean a lot of different things depending on the context and the relationship you have with this guy. It's 
Do you guys have actual Valentine’s Day plans? If you’re not in an actual relationship- whether exclusive or not, you shouldn’t expect anything. If you actually like him and want to do something on Valentine’s Day, forget the old fashioned way of thinking and just ask. I don’t see the harm.

Growing up, I always thought of Valentine’s Day as something romantic. I don’t think he needs to be sending her heart chocolate and getting her stuffed animals and flowers every year. Then she gets jealous of him taking me out for a Valentine’s Day dinner without stopping by to see her. </p>
