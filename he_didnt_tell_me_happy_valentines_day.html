        <h2><strong>he didnt tell me happy valentines day rose bear by valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>haven't seen my boyfriend since Friday, asked him to message me Sunday and we could figure out when to hang out again. he hasn't said anything since Friday and today is Valentine's day and nothingi know he doesn't like it but I do. a simple "happy Valentine's day" would be nice..I'm feel left out. + I'm always the one initiating conversations/asking to hang out. 
I didn't think it was stressful to just text someone "Happy Valentine's Day." Not to be rude, but it's something I also say to my family and friends, and at the very least, he and I are friends. We've been friendly to each other. He started the conversation for the day, so I figured it would have been nice for him to just wish me a happy holiday. 
Happy Valentine's Day, friend! It's really unfortunate that he didn't at least say the words to you :(. There's nothing wrong with you! It's been a common thread on this sub today that some boyfriends "don't believe in Valentines Day" or "won't celebrate [it]". This could be the case! 
Maybe he forgot. I say this because my girlfriend told me Happy Valentine’s Day today and I responded with “haha oh yeah, I forgot.” It’s not a big deal to a lot of people. I can’t stand this day. Unnecessary traffic everywhere. So maybe he doesn’t even like Valentine’s Day. Perhaps you could ask him what he thinks about  
After five dates, on the Saturday before Valentine's Day, we slept together. Valentine's Day comes and goes and he didn't mention it to me, didn't ask me out, or even say "Happy Valentines" day to me. 
Tell him he needs to shape up! 0 . 0 Reply. u. Iron_Man Follow. Master Age: 45. 1 y.  He didn't wish me a happy Valentine's day? He didn't even say happy Valentine  
Third, let him know that Valentine's Day is important to you. Let him know that February 14th can be as important to a woman as the Super Bowl is to a man. That, he will understand. Not every woman likes Valentine's Day. Not every couple wants to celebrate on a day where the menu prices are escalated. It's a very personal and emotional day for  
You have him right where you want him now. Offer to stop only if he'll take you to dinner and a movie. Tell him this is the very least he can do to make amends for his boorish behavior. Trust me, he will submit to you from this point forward. I see a happy future for you both, and a large house with many children. One day you'll thank me. 
He wished me a Happy V Day and said he hopes I am having a good day. He didn’t ask to see me, though. I am not that concerned about gifts or anything and I am happy he thought of me enough to contact me. But most of the advice here is that I should forget about him. I like him but I am confused on what to do. Should I stop talking to him? 
It's also good to set boundaries/expectations - i.e "For me to consider things are "going good" is for the person I'm dating to at least acknowledge Valentines Day, and at least get me a card. Work travel is not an excuse, if you can manage to get to your appointments timely, you can manage to put an alert on your phone to call me for a holiday". 
Valetines day I made a discord bot that would send her reasons I love her every day for 3 months. She got me nothing for any of those events. She did get me something for my birthday before we started dating and she drew me something for Christmas (so did I). How do I tell her that I'm kinda upset she didnt get me anything without sounding too  
As an example: If my way to offer and receive affection for my special someone is through sharing quality time with them and they just blow me off on Valentine's Day, I'd probably feel hurt too, unless we'd both discussed it and decided that Valentine's day didn't really hold any significance for us. 
If he's cancelling on you once he's found out it's Valentine's Day, he doesn't sound like much of a stand up guy. This is exactly what I don't get. I'm a guy that doesn't really "do" Valentine's Day, either, but I sure as hell wouldn't let it stop me from going out on a date that I already arranged. 
Valentine's Day comes and goes and he didn't mention it to me, didn't ask me out, or even say "Happy Valentines" day to me. I think the excuse "maybe he didn't know" is BS. 
If he didn‘t wanna get me flowers then why not just tell me that in advance when we were discussing it? It‘s not even about the flowers or how much they cost, it‘s that he didn‘t put 10 minutes of effort into something I care about :( 
He wished me a Happy V Day and said he hopes I am having a good day. He didn’t ask to see me, though. I am not that concerned about gifts or anything and I am happy he thought of me enough to contact me. But most of the advice here is that I should forget about him. I like him but I am confused on what to do. Should I stop talking to him? 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
The caption said, "Publix doesn't want you to forget it's Valentine's Day tomorrow." I got home, and he grabbed the car keys from me, saying, "I have to run to town real quick." He needed a little nudge, and frankly, he would have been sad all day if he forgot it was Valentine's Day so I was happy to give it. 
Feeling neglected on Valentine’s Day can really bring you down, but try to avoid letting it affect the rest of your day. If you’re seriously upset, try your best to pretend it's not Valentine's Day at all. Unlike most major holidays, Valentine's Day is relatively easy to ignore. 
So no, I will not tell him happy Valentine’s Day. He had his chance. I felt humiliated af. He lied as well that he wanted to focus on himself and be alone. I did so much for him in our relationship. Last year he didn’t even do anything for me, not even on my own birthday. </p>
