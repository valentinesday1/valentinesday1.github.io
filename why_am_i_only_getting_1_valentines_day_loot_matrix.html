        <p>Tower Defense Simulator (TDS) has released various Valentine’s Day-themed skins for existing units that can be obtained by completing the associated missions. 
The Valentine’s update in Dig It brings exciting new rewards, including the Heart Shovel, Flood Shovel, and exclusive event gifts. To get the most out of this event, make sure to dig on Valentine’s Island, log in for Benson’s Daily Rewards, and open your gifts on the correct dates. Dig It

In the latest Valentine's Day update for Dig It, the developers have added a brand new limited-time island to the base game Called Valentines. Like previous LTE islands, Valentine's Island also has multiple items to dig that require varying magnets. 
Well, what can I say. I picked up the Fright of the Bumblebee skin. In 2017. According to the Wiki, this was only available for the Halloween event in 2012. I don't see why any other of the limited time skins have not been added to the loot pool. I hadn't been keeping track of any heads / skins I found until fairly recently. 
But if you loot them all and you across 10-20 Gold Bars boundary, you will be banned. Automatically. But prephaps one month later, when your progress will be much higher. Why modders do that? They are trolling new players and trying them banned. Theyself dont loot that chest, they dont need them. My advice: Contact R* support, in purchase category. 
Since the Heart-Shaped Box was a LFR give out for first kill of the day, and LFR isn’t a thing in WOTLK Classic, it seems Heart-Shaped Box is not being given out for the first kill of the day for each characters Event boss kill. Would like clarification from GM if rocket mount has moved to drop table on the boss or if there are plans to somehow re-add the Heart-Shaped box 1st kill of day

Valentine’s shop sells exclusive items you will not find anywhere in Blox Fruits. You must hurry up and get the required number of hearts for those items before the event time runs out. 
Hey, just want to know before the sale ends if the valentines day items are going to be a one time only in Apex or whether they may be available in. 
In addition to the stuff other people have mentioned, it is so you can use alts to farm for the boxes ASAP. The boxes are legacy bound meaning that you can share them among your characters, so if you have a main that is in KotFE and an alt that is not yet, you can still aid your main with your alt through running heroics. 
Yeah, but something like this should have three settings for Fury, we shouldn't have to use a different spec loot drops to get the loot we want for our actual spec. Option 1. Fury: Only give me two-handed weapons. 2. Fury: Only give me one-handed weapons. 3. Fury: Fury is chaos; give me whatever the loot table decides. 
I just started doing heroics the other day on a character that unlocked the loot boxes from KOTFE, the ones that give out remnant armor and companion gofts. I switched over to an alt today and ran some heroics and noticed I am getting 2x loot boxes on this alt as opposed to the 1x loot boxes I go 
That means for the rest of the week I am forbidden from getting loot from that same raid, so it would take at least 5 or 6 weeks to get the full set (again, assuming I got extraordinarily lucky). I haven't really done any of the raid stuff yet, so I'm just very confused on the rules of it. 
Not a finite amount of loot but rather a finite amount of loots slots. There is a certain dmg threshold but its fairly low, but if you haven't managed to get into one of these "slots" i.e. tag mob earlier than they all filled with other players then it doesn't matter how much damage you'll do, you won't get any loot. 
When you go to Mann Up and choose Two Cities (or any other tour you wanna complete), then tick "missions not yet completed" box. Completing missions that you have already completed in your current tour will not give you any further loot. 
You can only get armor or weapons once per week per character. Thereafter you only get spoils. 
Actually it has the current loot pool with the addition of makeshift and primal weapons and if it wouldve dropped something that isn't in creative it just doesn't drop anything Reply reply More replies 
How often can you get loot from mythic? You may only loot bosses in Mythic dungeons once per week. If you had completed this dungeon in Mythic before, please wait until the weekly reset to repeat the dungeon for loot. Customer Support does not assist with resetting dungeon lockouts. What happens if you don’t finish a mythic in time? 
My friends and I were farming the last boss of master grasp for artifice armor. They kept getting two items to drop per clear and was on my Titan and kept getting only one drop and always a weapon. I switched to hunter and instantly get double drops every run. Switch back to titan and only 1 drop every time. </p>
