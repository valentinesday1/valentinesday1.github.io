    <section id="about">
        <h2><strong>my husband didn t give me anything for valentines day montelle winery valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
At the end of the day, what truly matters is the connection and love you share with your partner. Valentine's Day is just one day on the calendar, and a gift, or the lack thereof, shouldn't define your relationship. The most valuable thing is the time and effort you both invest in maintaining a strong and loving bond. 
My husband and I normally don’t do anything for Valentine’s Day but he used to get me flowers/food etc when we were dating. It wasn’t much, and I honestly didn’t care. But somehow this year, both of us have gotten busy and my husband (who was shitty before about planning romantic things) just 100% dropped the ball- no planning dinners  
Obviously I can’t give his side on my birthday situation, but he didn’t get me anything until the day of, and then didn’t plan a place to eat after just said “I don’t know we could go to eat at X place”. I told him later that I wanted to be thought of more, like more thought into the gift or the dinner/activity. 
I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
He would rather do nothing than risk disappointing me. Yes, I still feel a twinge of sadness when Valentine’s Day, my birthday, Mother’s Day, and Christmas come and go gift-free. I have to actively resist the urge to compare “my husband” to “her husband” as the photos go live on Facebook and Twitter. But then I remember that 
Then, proceed with letting him know that you felt sad not getting anything on Valentine’s Day, and you know you didn’t talk about it in advance, but you’d rather communicate it now than bottle it up inside you. The conversation should unfold by itself at this point. Of course, keep things calm, don’t blame, and don’t point fingers. 
I don't care for Valentine's Day so it doesn't bother me that we didn't really do anything. I texted my husband a screenshot of some cupcakes advertised by a local bakery and he went out and bought them five minutes later. That was our acknowledgement. I'm also not a super openly romantic person, and I don't like forced gestures. 
Every person in a relationship is looking out for various occasions: birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, and of course, Valentine’s Day.If you’re a lady, one thing you’d never want to ask your friends is this: “my boyfriend didn’t get me a Valentine’s gift; what should I do?”To spare you the embarrassment, our team researched and  
That's your own damn fault. It's just a day. Not even your anniversary. Me and my gf didn't even bring up that it's Valentines day. anything I said just sounded selfish when I put it into words. Not selfish, but childish. 
As an example: If my way to offer and receive affection for my special someone is through sharing quality time with them and they just blow me off on Valentine's Day, I'd probably feel hurt too, unless we'd both discussed it and decided that Valentine's day didn't really hold any significance for us. 
My Husband has never given me a gift or flowers or a box of chocolates on Valentine’s Day – and I’m ok with that. Becuase it means that I don’t have to give him anything either! We show our love to one another through quality time throughout the year, that’s what works for us and we both feel loved and valued. 
My girlfriend didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day So we are in a long distance relationship because we attend different universities, but Valentine’s Day came around and I sent her a nice little care package with a card and some other things. 
valentine's day is one of the dumbest holidays. i was never a fan of giving or receiving gifts and the like in general, so i wouldn't do anything for my partner and i wouldn't want him to do anything for me and i would refuse any gift unless he absolutely insisted on giving me one and was totally fine with not getting anything back. i do the  
OK we been married for 5 years and he never gave me anything he say he don't know what to get me .I don't understand like I get him something every year and still nothing last year he went with his brother to buy me a gift and he only got me a card and it was empty but his brother bought something for his girl like why he could not copy from his brother 
It can be downright disappointing when you take the Valentine’s Day Walk of Shame because your husband doesn’t send you flowers, plan a romantic evening or even give you a card. 
The only thing that bothers me is she didn’t do anything for me. At all. I didn’t want anything fancy. But a $2 card, a massage, maybe some special lingerie for the bedroom, just one of those would have made my night. She didn’t even do the one thing she had agreed to beforehand, she was supposed to handle dessert. 
He spend more than $1k for "the day". After dinner, she was like "I can't wait to see my present" and got mad because "The Day" didn't counted as a present. Maybe your gf saw what you did as not "presents" and decided that your relationship "don't do" gifts for celebration. 
This is the first time in 18 years I didn’t get my husband anything for Valentine’s Day and it’s because we are having some major relationship problems. Yes, men do need to be appreciated as well, she may have some deep issues with you that need to be discussed more. Good luck. </p>
