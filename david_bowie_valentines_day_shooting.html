        <h2><strong>david bowie valentines day shooting valentines day chocolates pad</strong></h2>
        <p>"Valentine's Day" is a song by English rock musician David Bowie, the fourth single from his 25th studio album The Next Day. The single was released on 19 August 2013. This was to be Bowie's final 7-inch single issued from a new album released in his lifetime. The lyrics are based on the psychology of a school shooter. [3] 
The Northern Illinois University shooting was a school shooting that took place on Thursday, February 14, 2008, at Northern Illinois University (NIU) in DeKalb, Illinois. Steven Kazmierczak, 27 years old and a 2006 NIU graduate, opened fire with a shotgun and three pistols in a crowd of students on campus, killing 5 students and injuring 17  
David Bowie released the single “Valentine’s Day” on August 19, 2013. It was also featured on his penultimate studio album, “The Next Day.” Judging by the title alone, it might seem like another love song. But the lyrics and the whole vibe of the track say otherwise. Written by Bowie himself, it’s about a shooter’s psychology. 
Valentine would be a smallish teenage boy and more importantly one who has resolved to engage in a mass shooting at his school. And when he proceeds to do so, said event is what is actually referred to in the lyrics as “Valentine’s Day”. Supposedly, this intent of the piece is to serve as David Bowie’s version of an anti-gun violence song. 
In fact, Bowie’s Valentine’s Day, and its accompanying video, actually contain a sobering message about gun control. It’s believed that the song refers to a 2008 University shooting in Northern Illinois which occurred on Valentine’s Day. The track was recorded by American producer Tony Visconti. 
The backing track for ‘Valentine’s Day’ was laid down on 24 July. Bowie’s lead vocals were recorded on 18 September. The video. On 15 July 2013 the promotional video for ‘Valentine’s Day’ was uploaded to David Bowie’s official YouTube channel.

Valentine's Day Lyrics &amp; Meanings: Valentine told me who's to go / Feelings he treasured most of all / The teachers and the football stars / It's in his tiny face / It's in his scrawny hands / Valentine sold his soul / He's got something to say / It's Valentine's day / The rhythm of the crowd / Benny and Judy down / Valentine sees it all / He's got something to say / It's Valentine's day  
Valentine's Day, by David Bowie was released in 2013 from the album, The Next Day, and as many people have noticed, it talks about the "warped perspective of a school shooter".

The earliest track recorded for The Next Day, this Trad-Rock stormer has nothing to do with February 14th, but instead namechecks the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre where seven mob associates were murdered as part of a Prohibition-era conflict between two powerful criminal gangs in Chicago. 
さて、このダグラス高校での事件が起きたのは、ボウイが「Valentine’s Day」をリリースした5年後に当たる。くしくも、この実行犯は精神病により「攻撃を支持するような声」が聞こえたという。まさに、Valentine’ Dayの曲の主人公のような状態である。 
David Bowie had a way of predicting events. The impending danger of the Internet (in the early 90s) and "Valentine's Day" prior to the Parkland sh00ting. I do understand he's referring to a kid named "Valentine", but nevertheless. I think about it every year. 
Klinko worked with Bowie on the album’s final single, “Valentine’s Day.” By then, Bowie was on a roll, and Klinko cannot help but compare The Next Day Bowie to the Bowie he met during Heathen. “When he said, ‘MTV won’t play it,’ it was definitely with some kind of disappointment,” he says.
