By the 1700s, valentines of the medieval era were popularized as handmade tokens—embellished with lace, dresdens, and ribbons—and exchanged between loved ones before they were started to be mass-manufactured in the mid-1800s.

During this time, it was commonly believed that birds began their mating season on February 14th, reinforcing the idea that this day was meant for  
Giving valentines. According to the lore, the second St. Valentine didn’t just fall in love with his jailer’s daughter. He also sent her a final farewell letter, signed “from your Valentine.” 
Where does the name Valentine come from?. The holiday is aptly named after Saint Valentine, but who exactly was he? Valentine is likely based on a combination of two Valentines who were executed on February 14 in different years by Roman Emperor Claudius II in the 3rd century A.C.E., according to NPR.
