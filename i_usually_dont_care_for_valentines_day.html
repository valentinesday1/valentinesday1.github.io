        <h2><strong>i usually dont care for valentines day legal humor valentines day cards</strong></h2>
        <p>Not participating in Valentine's Day could look intentional or give your partner the feeling that you don’t really care about them, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who works with men. Advertisement Plus, on Valentine’s Day, your wife or girlfriend is going to be clicking through Instagram story after Instagram story of date nights; over-the  
The reason why I dont care about Valentines Day is straightforward: I don't need a special day to remind me to express my love. 
People that call Valentine’s Day a “Hallmark holiday” are just trying to justify that they don’t want to celebrate it or spend any money. If you don’t want to celebrate Valentine’s Day, don’t. No one is forcing you. If both you &amp; your wife feel the same way, that makes it easy! 
How do more people not see or care that it is just a consumer holiday? Why do people feel like they need to spend money or receive a gift to feel loved. I know the answer to all of these questions (corporate greed, incessant advertising, conditioning) but it still bothers me. 
Between the burden of finding the perfect gift for your boo, the anxiety of finding a Valentine if you're single, and the pressure to spread love to people you don't even like, there are plenty 
Instead of trying to cram all your love celebrations into one day, resolve to show love the rest of the year and take Valentine's Day off. Or better yet, turn it into a day of radical 
Opting out of Valentine’s Day isn’t a reflection on your relationship. It matters not how you celebrate, but how you treat your relationship. 
When Valentine’s Day rolled around several months later, after exactly five texts exchanged between the two of us, and one Valentine sent to him through the mail a week before that had received no response (I told myself it just got lost, or that he was likely just thinking up the perfect reply), I dialed his number, expecting a romantic  
Sure. Rather than let a marketing firm decide for them, every couple can decide for themselves whether or how to use the opportunity that Valentine’s Day provides. Some will use it to do something they don’t usually do, like go out for an expensive dinner or get a couple’s massage. 
Valentine’s Day is the only holiday dedicated to celebrating a human emotion—love. While it is often associated with romance, it should be embraced as a broader celebration of love in all its  
My husband and I don't do huge gestures for Valentine's day- but it's pretty equal. We used to go out to dinner, now we cook together. We get each other cards and a small gift, but mostly we get our kids little gifts But no, Valentine's day is not akin to your female partners birthday. It's a day to celebrate those you love, mutually. 
Making an effort on Valentine's Day is great if you're SO is into it, but if you don't it doesn't mean you don't care about them. The same argument could be made in the reverse. If someone demands stuff on Valentines Day then they don't care about the person who doesn't want to celebrate it. That's why that's flawed logic. 
15 affordable Valentine’s Day ideas. Valentine’s Day can be a special day for you and your partner, irrespective of your financial condition. It is about spending quality time with the one that you love. So, what are some free Valentine ideas? Consider the list below. 1. Workout together 
On Valentine's Day women give homemade chocolate to their valentines and men return the favor by buying a personal gift/chocolate for white day. So yeah that is what I'm going to do to my boyfriend of 6 months. 
After this weird Valentine's day I explained how I never celebrate Valentine's day, I don't understand it and gave her the consumerism spiel. She said she wasn't really big on Valentine's day either but wanted to show me how she feels. I told her she didn't have to get me anything and that I really don't enjoy Valentine's day. She respected it. 
Cool. That's probably the most common thing cuz most people break up right before good events like Christmas, New Year's Day and Valentine's Day, from personal experience. So relax, this isn't uncommon at all and don't feel bad due to the few Lucky ones that get it. Not everyone has to make use of luck. 
For me, I don't really care about valentine's day. But the most important thing to me for special occasions is just to spend time with my SO. Since you unfortunately won't be able to be with her on that day, I'd have something or other delivered so she knows you're thinking of her and wish that you could be together. Plan your OWN valentine's day. 
Been "officially" single for about 8 years now. I actually left my ex after Valentines Day (for several reasons, and was finally fed up). But generally, Valentine's means little to me. I don't need one day to do the things that we should be doing on any day of the year. 
I don't care much about valentine's day but since we celebrate it, we usually both do something for each other or just plan to spend some time together. This year, I'm taking him ice-kayaking, ice-fishing and grilling sausages and smores on a campfire and then we're cooking a special meal together. 
Even a simple “happy Valentine’s Day” message makes a world of difference , Esp during Covid where some countries are still in lockdown. I don’t believe that Valentine’s Day is solely for partners , I think it’s just a day that you should show the people around you how much you care for them ☺️ ️ </p>
