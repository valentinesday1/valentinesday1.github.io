        <p>The ways we recognize and talk about abuse, control and harm remain largely trapped in outdated narratives—ones that fail to account for the complexities of love beyond traditional partnerships. Expanding the definition of domestic violence is not about diluting its meaning; it’s about making it more accurate. In recent years, Valentine’s Day has been reclaimed and reshaped to celebrate  
In recent years, Valentine’s Day has been reclaimed and reshaped to celebrate love in all its forms – beyond romance and sex. Galentine’s Day, self-love rituals, and the celebration of deep platonic connections have gained mainstream recognition, expanding our collective understanding of what love can be. Slowly, we’ve made space for  
Here are some examples of challenges many LGBTQ people face during the Valentine's Day season: 1. Buying A Card. Recently, there has been some progress made in this front: Hallmark, for 
As Valentine's Day nears, many of us won't be able to escape what it's like dating in modern American politics. This is my experience. Realizing I'm queer was a big part of my dating life 
For same-sex couples and the broader LGBTQ+ community, the holiday has long presented a heteronormative, cisnormative vision of love which excludes anyone outside a narrow definition of ‘normal’. 
How does Valentine’s Day affect members of the LGBTQ+ community? Valentine’s Day can be a difficult time for some because so many depictions of relationships are hetero and cis normative. Queer folks in relationships may hesitate to be open about their relationships in order to maintain safety. 
But more specifically, Valentine’s Day—just like most mainstream concepts—is very heterosexual in nature. So lesbians, along with other gay and queer people, have to figure out where they fit 
Although Valentine’s Day does not directly help fight the day-to-day inequalities of our society, we can choose to participate in the holiday while continuing to be an ally to the LGBTQ community. Here are some ways you can celebrate Valentine’s Day and support your local LGBTQ community. 
Valentine's Day largely remains the promotion of heterosexual love because of a lack of same-sex love visibility. When there is same-sex love or sexual behavior visibility, it 
Recent statistics showcase a long standing trend — LGBT people are still four times more likely to experience violence in their life than their straight counterparts. FBI data from 2019 illustrates a rise in anti-LGBTQIA+ hate crimes, including higher rates of police brutality. 
Don't forget the oppressive history that continually reminds us of the work still needed to be done.  commemorating the first anniversary of the multi-day unrest in which trans and queer people  
Unlike past entries in queer cinema, though, these films focus on overcoming oppression. Sometimes, remaining authentic to oneself amidst conflict is the greatest goal. 
The majority of LGBTQ Americans say they have experienced some form of harassment or discrimination due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to a report by the Harvard T.H  
4. Don’t forget about these things after Valentine’s Day! When people only remember LGBTQ people during Pride month (June) or during specific holidays or events, it can feel like pandering, or insincere. Instead, you can use Valentine’s Day as an excuse to start being more inclusive, and keep it up all year long. 
Parades are a prominent feature of Pride month, alongside community events, festivals, rallies, public speaking, and educational sessions, many of which are covered by mainstream media and attract millions of participants. Unfortunately, despite all the awareness and celebration within the community, many still face discrimination to this day. 
Heavily substantiated with reference to hundreds of academic writings, Why The Clergy Lied: A Journalist's Academic Report on LGBTQ+ and Christianity brings together critical commentary on the deceptions driving religious oppression of LGBTQ persons through a significant part of Christian Church history. Numerous books have been written about  
Valentine’s Day is around the corner, and I feel like I haven’t been able to buy toiletries for the past two weeks without a heart-shaped balloon hitting me in the face. 
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) people continue to experience various forms of oppression and discrimination in North America and throughout the world, despite the social, legal, and political advances that have been launched in an attempt to grant LGBT people basic human rights. Even though LGBT people and communities have been actively engaged in community organizing and  
You can support the community by donating money to a marginalized person’s crowdfunding campaign, donating money to a renowned LGBTQ+ group, and many more. Inclusive of all voices A good LGBTQ+ ally will include all queer voices like BIPOC people, sex workers, impoverished trans people, people with disabilities, and many other identities. 
Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It may have had beginnings in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which celebrated the coming of spring and included fertility rites and other activities, but the origin of the holiday is vague at best. </p>
