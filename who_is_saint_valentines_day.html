        <h2><strong>who is saint valentines day porn site valentines day charity</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in

St. Valentine (died 3rd century, Rome; feast day February 14) was the name of one or two legendary Christian martyrs whose lives seem to have a historical basis. Although the Roman Catholic Church continues to recognize St. Valentine as a saint of the church, he was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1969 because of the lack of reliable  
The Feast of Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine's Day, was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of the Christian martyr. [41] A shrine of Saint Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland. February 14 is Saint Valentine's Day in the Lutheran calendar of saints. [12] 
Two Valentines are listed in the Roman Martyrology for February 14. The first Saint Valentine was a Roman priest who reportedly was martyred on the Flaminian Way during the reign of the Emperor Claudius. The other Saint Valentine was a third-century bishop of Terni who was martyred in Rome but whose relics were sent back to his home see. 
Saint Valentine's Legacy and Holiday. Saint Valentine was executed on February 14, around the year 269 AD. Over time, this date became associated with celebrating love and affection, leading to the modern Valentine's Day holiday. 
In a 1981 academic article, the late University of Kansas English professor Jack B. Oruch argued that Chaucer's 1375 poem “Parlement of Foules” was the first to record St. Valentine's Day as a  
The association of Valentine's Day with love and romance can be traced back to the 14th century, particularly through the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Chaucer, in his poem "Parliament of Foules," for the first time linked the tradition of courtly love with the feast of St. Valentine, suggesting that birds chose their mates on this particular day.

The popular customs of showing love and affection on St. Valentine’s Day is almost a coincidence with the feast day of the saint: During the Medieval Age, a common belief in England and France was that birds began to pair on Feb.14, “half-way through the second month of the year.”

Such is the case with Valentine’s Day when Pope Galesius I eliminated Lupercalia in the 400s and replaced the holiday with a day to commemorate St. Valentine. Nevertheless, even saying that Galesius replaced Lupercalia with St. Valentine’s Day might be a myth in itself, writes Helen Flatley in her article. 
This famous saint, an Italian doctor who later became a priest, inspired the creation of the holiday of Valentine's Day. He was sent to jail for performing weddings for couples during a time when new marriages were outlawed in the ancient Rome.

The saint we celebrate on Valentine’s Day is known officially as St. Valentine of Rome in order to differentiate him from the dozen or so other Valentines on the list. Because “Valentinus

In the end, we don’t know which St. Valentine is the namesake for the holiday. A St. Valentine is listed in the Roman Martyrology (the Church’s official list of martyrs) on Feb. 14. Likely because little is known about him, St. Valentine is not listed on the General Roman Calendar, which governs the liturgical celebrations of the saints.
