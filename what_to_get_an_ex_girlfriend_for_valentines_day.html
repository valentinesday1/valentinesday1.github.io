I’m asked quite a bit this time of year by a hurting client if they should send a gift to their ex on Valentine’s Day. Be sure to watch the video above all the way through FIRST if you have the following questions: “Should I send flowers to my ex girlfriend on Valentine’s Day?” 
Valentine’s Day affords a unique opportunity to connect. An ice-breaker like this Best Ex Husband Ever coffee mug may help rebuild the bridge between you and your ex. Set Realistic Expectations For Yourself. I’ve talked about figuring out what you hope to accomplish from sending your ex a gift on Valentine’s Day. 
Shortly after, curiousity brought me to my ex’s facebook page and BOOM, she’s in a new relationship with someone that is SOOO not her type. I assume they are spending their Valentine’s day together while I’m alone in my apartment sort of just wishing for some emotional and physical connection with someone today. 
Price: $17.99 Celebrate the love you share with the Sips of Love Mug, a heartfelt Valentine’s Day surprise she’ll use and adore. Featuring a charming personalized design, this mug is perfect for cozy mornings or relaxing evenings with her favorite drink.

Gift Idea #5.Get Her A Gift From The Kids. I got this suggestion from a reader named Chris, and it’s a great idea. This works especially well if you have young kids. 
Do you think it is appropriate for me (23m) to buy my girlfriends (23f) sister (27f) a Valentine’s Day gift (flowers, non roses/something)? My girlfriend and her sister still live at home with their parents and my girlfriends sister doesn’t have a boyfriend and hasn’t been in a serious relationship for a long time (she seems lonely). 
Valentine's Day is a particularly sensitive and emotional day for some people, and even if you and your ex are on great terms, they may need space on a holiday all about romantic feelings. </p>
