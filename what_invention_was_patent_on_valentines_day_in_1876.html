        <h2><strong>what invention was patent on valentines day in 1876 valentines day colorikng</strong></h2>
        <p>On February 14, 1876, a patent application was filed for the telephone by the putative inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell. However, earlier that morning Mr. Elisha Gray applied for a patent on a variable resistance communication device. 
The invention that was submitted for a patent on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1876, was the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell, a Scottish-born inventor, filed his patent application titled "Improvement in Telegraphy" for this revolutionary device. 
Valentine's Day in 1876 was the day inventor Alexander Graham Bell – born in Edinburgh before moving to Canada, and then the US – filed the first patent for the telephone. One of the major inventions that was patented on Valentine's Day is the telephone. 
On February 14, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell submitted his patent application for the telephone. This groundbreaking invention revolutionized communication by allowing sound to be transmitted over long distances. 
On Valentine’s Day 1876 Bell and Gray each submitted an application to the U.S. Patent Office for a device to transmit the human voice over a wire—in other words, a telephone. On March 7, 1876, after reviewing their competing applications, the patent office awarded a patent to Bell, saying his papers had arrived two hours before Gray’s. 
It’s February 14, 1876. Valentine’s Day, for those running about with a romantic bent. Nearly one hundred years after the US Declaration of Independence, for those of a more historical nature. If you had been in Boston, Massachusetts, that morning, loitering near the US Patent Office, you may have noticed a man rushing in to file for a patent. 
More than three decades after the idea of a telephone was first considered by Innocenzo Manzetti, two Americans rushed to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on February 14, 1876 to claim credit for the world-changing invention. 
On February 14, 1876 — Valentine's Day — Gray and Alexander Graham Bell both filed patents for an "electric speaking telephone" but Bell was given rights to the device. 
Mr Bell submitted his application and got his drawing approved on the 14th of Feb, 1876. But, Mr Gray had only filed a Patent Caveat, which he later withdrew on advice from his attorney. This in turn led to a years-long dispute, which was finally settled in favor of Mr Bell. 
On St. Valentine’s Day, February 14, 1876, attorneys for Alexander Graham Bell filed a patent application. A few hours later that same day attorneys for Elisha Gray filed his caveat. Both Bell’s application and Gray’s caveat illustrated devices that electrically transmitted sounds over a wire. 
Basically a Valentine’s Day Chia Pet, the heart-shaped, free-standing, living horticultural plants were patented on February 19, 1991 by Gene L. Howe, sadly a few days late for Valentine’s that year. 
Valentine’s Day suggests hearts and flowers rather than legal patents but one of the most famous patents issued was registered on February 14, 1876, when a lawyer for Alexander Graham Bell filed an application for his telephone invention; an instrument (and its modern day successors) that has played a large role in keeping lovers connected ever since.

Oh, yes, I realize that Sunday is Valentine’s Day, but the historic event I’m referring to is the Feb. 14, 1876 race to the patent office between Alexander Graham Bell and Ohio’s own Elisha Gray. Their battle over the invention of the telephone spurred significant litigation that lasted for years.

There is no record of a product patent for a "revolutionary" product on Valentine's Day of 1876, but Alexander Graham Bell received a patent for the telephone on March 7, about 3 weeks after Oh, yes, I realize that Sunday is Valentine’s Day, but the historic event I’m referring to is the Feb. 14, 1876 race to the patent office between  
“Whatever evidence there is, is in favor of the caveat having been filed first.” — Elisha Gray Valentine’s day is no ordinary day. Especially in the patent world. It is the day when one of the most important patents the world was filed &amp; stamped – the telephone. A difference of just a few hours between the application filed by 
Valentine’s Day is filled not only with cards, roses and chocolates but plenty of history as well.  1876, to issue the first patent for a telephone, United States Patent No. 174,465, to Bell  </p>
