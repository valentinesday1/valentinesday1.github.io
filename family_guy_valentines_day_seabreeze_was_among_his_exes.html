        <p>Following a special Valentine's opening, Lois talks Peter into spending the day in bed. As Peter tries to make things romantic, Lois finds that spending the day together isn't as neat as she planned. Peter gets a call from a former girlfriend who tries to separate Peter from Lois. 
"Valentine's Day in Quahog" (also known as "The Family Guy 200th Episode Celebration") is the twelfth episode of the eleventh season and the 200th overall episode of the animated comedy series Family Guy. It aired on Fox in the United States on February 10, 2013. The episode was written by Daniel Palladino and directed by Bob Bowen. [1]

[all of Brian's ex-girlfriends sitting gathered in the living room] Brian: Stewie, what the hell?! These are all my ex-girlfriends! Stewie: Well, I thought they could provide some insights that might improve your love life. Ladies, as you may have guessed, you are here because you have all dated this great guy. Yet, somehow, things didn't work out.

Peter, are you ready for your Valentine's gift? No, but I'm ready for therapy. ♪ Family Guy 11x12 ♪ Valentine's Day in Quahog Original Air Date on February 10, 2013. Peter, you awake? It's a beautiful day. Um, yeah, I'm just glad I didn't die from the weird sleep-breathing thing I have. (screaming) 
Now I don’t like Brian, but I found it unfair that Brooke was in the intervention that Stewie set up with Brian’s exs on the Valentine’s day episode. Brooke was never with Brian. She was never interested in him to begin with. With Seabreeze, well she was never with Brian and those puppies she had was never Brian’s.

Seabreeze is the prize-winning dog of Lois' parents, the Pewterschmidts. In "Screwed the Pooch", Brian rushes onto a dog track while Seabreeze is racing and "violates" her. According to Tricia Takanawa, who did a news story on Seabreeze, it turns out that she's the heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune. She later gives birth to puppies, who are not Brian's, but Ted Turner's. Afterwards, Carter  
Hello There Clammers! Brian Griffin is one smooth talking dog. With his class and sophistication he's gotten his fair share of the "ladies". And with Jillian making a return to Quahog with the New Year's Event we thought it'd be fun to take a look back at Brian's Exes and see which one is your 
They even have Seabreeze among his exes. I have to respect these women for their honesty about Brian, but the episode is telling me I have to be on HIS SIDE! To be fair, it's the only plot to make me laugh in the whole episode, but Brian's hypocrisy will always be what makes him the worst character. 
Fall in love with the hilarious Family Guy crew this Valentine's Day! In this 3-episode special, the Griffins tackle love, romance, and everything in between 
However, they, like their parents, had their plans for the day. "Happy Valentine's Day, honey," Brian addressed his wife. "Happy Valentine's Day to you, Brian," Barbara addressed back. "Whenever you're ready, I'll go get my hat, jacket and purse." The two had planned a very special dinner date for two for the night. Brian happily shook his head.

BRIAN GETS ALL HIS EXES THIS VALENTINE’S DAY ON FAMILY GUY So, not only is Bart Simpson going on a personal journey that sees him getting in touch with all of his ex-girlfriends, but Brian Griffin is also setting up to do the same thing. Turns out Stewie is gets a bunch of Brian’s ex-girlfriends to try and figure out why Brian is unable to  
The opening to the episode is a parody on the trailer to the 2010 romantic-comedy film Valentine's Day. The pose in Meg's picture is a reference to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse photos. Glenn's becoming Glenda bears some similarities to the film Glen or Glenda about about cross-dressing and transsexuality.
