        <p>“Valentine’s Day” is a track from the album “Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)”, released in 2000. It was produced by Dave Sardy and Marilyn Manson himself and features Jeordie White on lead guitar and Ginger Fish on drums, among others. 
"Valentine's Day" by Marilyn Manson touches upon themes of darkness, death, and the contrast between beauty and despair. The lyrics evoke a sense of dystopia, emphasizing the destructive nature of society and the individual struggles within it.
