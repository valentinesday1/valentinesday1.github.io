        <p>The Forgotten Realms--D&amp;D's most popular campaign setting--have been around for a long time, and over those years a full calendar evolved: a 365-day year split into 12 months lasting 30 days (or 3  
The origins of Valentine's Day in your D&amp;D game. The Gods of the Multiverse appendix of the Player’s Handbook can be a source of inspiration for deities that might benefit from a celebration of love. 
The Calendar of Harptos was the calendar used across most of Faerûn. It was created by the wizard Harptos of Kaalinth,[1] although most people associate the word "Harptos" with the calendar. It was split into twelve months, each lasting three tendays (or thirty days).[2] There were an additional five days that fell between months, bringing the total number of days in most years to 365.[3] The  
More often than not there are flavors from many cultures and historical locations used on the Forgotten Realms side in one place, not only one. So the Forgotten Realms side is more of a hybrid and a unique mix rather than based on a 1:1 map. And certainly there is original content and thinking in as well. 
There, it is celebrated as a feast, wherein the local lords plan out the rest of the year. New alliances are forged and old ones are renewed, which sometimes involves the exchange of gifts and other tribute. It is also known as "Deadwinter Day" to the common folk of the Realms, marking the middle of the cold season. 3rd Edition [edit] 
The years of Faerun are divided up into categories like our B.C. and A.D.; the Dalereckoning marked the year of a truce between the elves of Cormanthyr and human settlers in the Dales. Thus, all the years after 1 DR are listed as being DR, or Dalereckoning years. There does not appear to be an equivalent to our B.C. term.

Durge: The head of that arms dealer who was giving you trouble, yes. The rest of him was left at the foot of his childrens' beds. Gortash: You always know how to make me smile, dear old friend. 
Hey guys. In my next campaign, I intend to track the days of the year as the players go through the campaign very closely. I'm relatively familiar with the calendar as it's described in the Players Handbook/DM's Guide/Sword Coast Guide, but are there any more in depth sources I can consult on the calendar, seasonal changes, special holidays, etc.? 
So here it is, according to a forgotten realms wiki and the old AD&amp;D Forgotten Realms Campaign sourcebook that I dug up for the occasion. Instead of weeks they have Tendays, which is, well, ten days long. Most months have 3 Tendays (30 days), and there are 5 additional days between some months (listed down). Months (and RL semi-equivalent) are:

I don't know if there's any particular cannon for that, but if I were going this route on the continent of Faerun I'd pick the town of Arabel. Their main exports among other things are a fine red wine and cheese and it's near forrested area which is a decent analog for old world France. 
I'm planning to run a Dickens' Christmas Carol equivalent adventure and wondered if there were resources about Deadwinter Day traditions in Faerûn to build on. dnd-5e-2014 forgotten-realms 
what are you talking about. valentine's day is a day for love there is no such thing as "galentine's day." in japan, there are two days that are distinct, women buy stuff for men on feb 14 and then a month later on "white day" the men reciprocate. this was obviously invented by commercial interests. 
There’s no Zodiac by that name, though there are several differing-by-race-and-culture systems of constellations, nor are people deemed to have characteristics because of the “sign they’re born under” or “year they’re born in, but instead, on Toril, individuals are said to be marked by a “guiding star” or “falling star

Instead, they're referred to by number: first-day, second-day, and so on. Most folk start counting using their thumb as first-day, but halflings are famous for using their pinkies to count first-day, so much so that the phrase "counting like a halfling" means that someone is being different just to be difficult.
