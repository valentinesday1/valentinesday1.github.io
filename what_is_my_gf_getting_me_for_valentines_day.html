Whatever you celebrate on February 14—Valentine’s Day, Galentine’s Day, or the birthday of illustrious suffragette Anna Howard Shaw—it’s an opportunity to show the lady in your life some  
Some quick context my gf (19f) and I (19f) have been together for a couple months and today is obviously valentines. I met up with her a couple days ago cause I knew she would be busy today, so I could give her her gifts. 
Valetines day I made a discord bot that would send her reasons I love her every day for 3 months. She got me nothing for any of those events. She did get me something for my birthday before we started dating and she drew me something for Christmas (so did I). How do I tell her that I'm kinda upset she didnt get me anything without sounding too  
As an example: If my way to offer and receive affection for my special someone is through sharing quality time with them and they just blow me off on Valentine's Day, I'd probably feel hurt too, unless we'd both discussed it and decided that Valentine's day didn't really hold any significance for us. 
personally, getting my SO a gift feels forced and it makes me anxious, because my SO is very thoughtful and expects the same level of thoughtfulness. I simply lack the thoughtfulness. the red flag will come IF you bring up your hurt feeling about not getting a gift, AND she dismisses it, diminishes it, or is generally Un sympathetic. 
I am a 25-year-old woman and I love men and I love Valentine’s Day. Here is my advice for you. Get 1 thing that is a traditional romantic gift, and get 1 thing that says something about your girlfriend’s personality. Or, even better, combine the two. For example, if she loves whales, you could get her candy that’s shaped like whales. 
He had written me a poem, rolled it up in a bottle and mailed it to me while he was deployed. -a romance novel where he was the hero and I was the heroine. I read a lot and am a hopeless romantic, so this was an amazing gift. Also, he had to fill out things about me to get the story right, like my eye color, hair color, favorite items, etc. 
That's your own damn fault. It's just a day. Not even your anniversary. Me and my gf didn't even bring up that it's Valentines day. anything I said just sounded selfish when I put it into words. Not selfish, but childish. 
My wife made me a box containing 52 dates. Some were blue sky dependant, some were an evening, some a weekend. We put a pin in a map of Wales and went on a road trip, had a picnic, went to a National Trust property, had a date in a bookstore, went on a food crawl where you have a starter in one restaurant, then a main in another and dessert in another. 
Valentine's day is generally accepted to be a day to treat your wife/girlfriend well. My wife has literally NEVER got me anything for valentines day in the 17 years we've been together. I go all out for her though, every year. She knocks it out of the park on my bday, wedding anniversary, father's day, religious holidays. Valentine's day though  
She probably didn’t have too high expectations anyways. I’d say wait till your birthday to decide on how you really feel about this. Like Valentine’s Day is for the ladies. I didn’t do shit for my bf of 7 years lol on any Valentine’s Day actually, but then his birthday the day we celebrate HIM I go alll out. </p>
