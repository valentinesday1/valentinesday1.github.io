        <p>You found someone who puts up with your bad dirty dish habits, and you owe it to them to do something nicer than takeout and a Julia Roberts movie for Valentine’s Day this year.

While many of the more coveted restaurants have been booked for weeks, OKC's dining scene has plenty to offer when it comes to restaurants that don't take reservations.

On Valentine’s Day, many people join a larger community of diners, all seeking a special night out in town at a new restaurant or a beloved spot. 
Valentine’s Day isn’t just for couples. Our survey data shows that 23.5% of people plan to dine with family, and 21.2% with friends. Offer flexible dining options such as group packages, private dining spaces, or shareable platters that can accommodate a variety of celebrations beyond just romantic dates. 
Carrabba's is serving a four-course meal for Valentine's Day. This meal is for two, and is available from February 6th to 16th. Courses include an appetizer, soup or salad, entrée, and dessert. 
Valentine’s Day is notoriously one of the worst days to dine out — ask any chef, and they’ll confirm — overpriced prix fixe menus, rushed service from overworked kitchen and front-of-house staff, and every couple in the city fighting for that coveted 7:30 p.m. reservation. It’s the perfect  
If a fancy five-course meal isn't your Valentine's Day jam, consider picking up one or more of Chick-fil-A's heart-shaped trays. Choose from four tray options that include 30 nuggets, 10 Chick-n  
According to an Open Table survey, 71% of Americans plan to go out to dinner on Valentine’s Day—an enormous number! Restaurants are notoriously packed during dinner. Even the bar may be busy, so be patient and don’t show up famished, in case food arrives slower than usual. 
I still rated 5-stars because service was excellent and the waiters were super friendly and gave advice on the menu. The food that followed was amazing. My recommendation for the restaurant is to remove the feature of reservations for special events or reservations in general if you won't even have a specific table ready for the guest upon arrival. 
But what truly sets our little gem apart is the love, dedication, and a warm, cozy atmosphere that make everyone feel right at home. Our mission is simple: to make every guest feel like a part of our family and to savor real, homemade dishes from our family-owned restaurant, all at prices that won't break the bank. 
Take her out the weekend AFTER Valentines day, but acknowledge V day with her.

Call them up and ask if you can make booking on V day. If full, then its packed.

Even restaurants that normally offer great service can flounder come Valentine's Day. When we asked some restaurant-industry folks about the challenges, almost everyone mentioned the chaos of temporarily breaking up four- and six-tops and communal tables to reformat the restaurant as couples-friendly, which leads to confusion in service.

LPT: if you want crappy food, crappy service, and crazy crowds at restaurants, book your Valentine's dinner now. I don't care how good the restaurant is at other times of the year, on Valentine's Day, it will just be subpar. Wow your date by making food at home or ordering a pizza and make it just the two of you.
