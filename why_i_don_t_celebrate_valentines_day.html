        <p>Opting out of Valentine’s Day isn’t a reflection on your relationship. It matters not how you celebrate, but how you treat your relationship. 
Not to mention, the pressure to go above and beyond on one designated, high-stakes day turns Valentine’s into more of an obligation than a joyful, authentic celebration. 
Here are all the reasons why strong couples may not want to celebrate Valentine's Day, according to experts. 1. They Don’t Need To Flaunt Their Relationship Status. With TikTok 
Valentine;s Day is a holiday all about romance, but what happens if someone's every day life is already filled with romance? Here's why one woman decided to stop celebrating Valentine's Day. 
An opinion piece on why celebrating commercialized Valentine's Day shouldn't be a big deal when it comes to your relationship. Why have we placed so much emphasis on celebrating one specific day each year? 
Valentine’s Day should be a medium to celebrate love, not an obligation. For many couples in the US, the day is seen as a chance to express feelings, but not the only day worth celebrating. 
Instead of trying to cram all your love celebrations into one day, resolve to show love the rest of the year and take Valentine's Day off. Or better yet, turn it into a day of radical 
I don’t mean to sound cynical, but regardless of the origins of the holiday, Valentine’s Day nowadays is rooted in commercialized romance. It’s part of why there are so many unnecessary expectations; it’s a selling point for companies to get you to buy their stuff all in the name of love. 
And how do they celebrate their love if not on Valentine’s Day? These are pressing questions, and we have answers! We spoke a few happy couples about their anti-Valentine sentiments, and here's what they had to say. 
Figure 1: Celebrating Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day Planning. The most important reason for celebrating Valentine’s Day is the significant other or partner, as shown in Table 2. This is followed by a fun thing to do. Interestingly, 10.4% say that “It is expected of me.” Table 2: Reasons to Celebrate Valentine’s Day 
As a girlfriend, fiancée, and now wife, I have discovered the wisdom in my man's choice to buck the system and not celebrate Valentine's Day. Sure, there were times when I wished he would have. And there were times (early in our relationship), when I pressured him into doing something special on that one day a year. 
Why I don’t Celebrate Valentine’s Day. Forget the shiny hearts — real love is dull, dependable, and hardcore  I don’t like Valentine’s day, and it’s not something my man and I have  
I don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day because it embodies everything I have come to believe is the opposite of what real love is. I will tell you what I believe true love is. True love is your significant other knowing your greatest fears and weaknesses and supporting you through the agonizing work of conquering them. 
Short Answer: If you look into the history and origins of Valentine Day, plus the values this celebration promotes today, the answer to your question will be very clear. . Muslims don’t blindly follow the crowd when it comes to celebrations of any k 
Yes, Valentine’s Day is about love, but the kind of selfless, dangerous sacrificial love it recognizes is trivialized by lacy cards and chocolates. Why I Don’t Celebrate Valentine’s Day  
Making an effort on Valentine's Day is great if you're SO is into it, but if you don't it doesn't mean you don't care about them. The same argument could be made in the reverse. If someone demands stuff on Valentines Day then they don't care about the person who doesn't want to celebrate it. That's why that's flawed logic. 
For us, Valentine's Day is a "light" holiday. Like, I don't go all out for VDay for my husband like for Christmas. I maybe get him some chocolate, make sure to tell him happy Valentine's Day. Make him a nicer-than-usual dinner. He will likely forget that it's Valentine's Day until I mention it. He is a kind person, but he's a tad bit forgetful. 
And then there’s this: you don’t have to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Do you make plans with your partner just because that’s the thing to do? That right there is reason enough not to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Sometimes deciding together to skip Valentine’s Day festivities is more romantic than celebrating half-heartedly or on pins  
Many Jews refuse to celebrate Christmas as a result, primarily due to its Christian roots. Valentine’s Day, however, has an even darker history tied to it. As Haaretz — one of the predominant Jewish news sources — explains, on Valentine’s Day in 1349, the “citizens of Strasbourg” slaughtered or forcibly converted Jews en masse.
