        <h2><strong>captain cook valentines day history anjali jewellers valentines day offer</strong></h2>
        <p>Most people think of Feb. 14 as Valentine's Day. But the date also marks a noteworthy event in Hawaiʻi's history: the death of British explorer and Navy Capt. James Cook on Hawaiʻi Island. HPR's Kuʻuwehi Hiraishi has more on why that date is so significant to many Native Hawaiians. 
The history of Valentine’s Day itself is murky and confused. The modern American holiday has undeniably been shaped by commercial interests. Commemorating the death of Captain Cook seems to be becoming a form of conscious anti-colonial alternative to what some perceive as the vapid commercialism of Valentine’s Day. 
On February 14, 1779, Captain James Cook, the great English explorer and navigator, is killed by Native Hawaiians during his third visit to the Pacific island group. In 1768, Cook, a surveyor in  
Valentine’s Day is filled not only with cards, roses and chocolates but plenty of history as well.  Captain James Cook is killed: 1779. 
Glyn Williams, a history professor emeritus at Queen Mary University of London, partially corroborated this account in his 2009 book The Death of Captain Cook: A Hero Made and Unmade, reporting that while the British expedition actually reached Kealakekua Bay in January 1779, Cook was indeed “wrapped in red cloth and presented a hog” during  
February 14 is most commonly known as Valentine's Day, but for many people of the Pacific, it also carries another significance — it's the day British naval captain James Cook died in Hawaii. 
The death of Captain Cook has been long painted as a great explorer brutally felled by a lesser race. The truth, however, is entirely different. Hau’oli La Ho’omake ia Kapena Kuke! Or, as the Hawai’ians call Valentine’s Day: Happy Death of Captain Cook day. 
Cook’s plan, however, was foolhardy in the extreme. On Valentine’s day 1779 he launched from his ship in the company of armed marines, who attempted to take the ruling chief Kalaniʻōpuʻu hostage. Although the chief left with Cook and returned to the beach without violence, there they were confronted by the angry relatives of Kalaniʻōpuʻu. 
As I mentioned in my last post, Valentine’s Day wasn’t always hearts and flowers, sometimes it was a day of blood and guts. On this day in 1779 the Hawaiians killed one of the world’s most important explorers, Captain James Cook. Le Capne. Jacques Cook Membre de la Societe Royale de Londres, circa 1775 
3 bloody and brutal events that happened on Valentine's Day The ships then headed north to look for the western end of a northwest passage from the North Atlantic to the Pacific. Almost one year later, Cook's two ships returned to the Hawaiian Islands and found a safe harbor in Kealakekua Bay. 
On the very same Valentine’s Day as the death of Captain James Cook, in the deep country of Georgia, United States, an army of around 400 American revolutionaries prepared to charge a force of around 700 British Imperial soldiers. Things had looked bleak for the revolutionaries.
