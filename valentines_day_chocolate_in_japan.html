        <h2><strong>valentines day chocolate in japan in kaichou wa maidsama whoch chapter has the valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Japan also observes a unique reciprocal holiday on March 14th, known as White Day, where men return the favour to those who gifted them chocolates on Valentine’s Day. This was created by the confectionery industry in the late 1970s and has since become a firmly established part of our Valentine’s Day cycle. 
Valentine’s Day in Japan has a unique history and customs that many foreigners find interesting. According to the Japan Chocolate &amp; Cocoa Association, this custom started in the 1950s. A chocolate company put up a handwritten “Valentine’s Sale” sign at Isetan department store in Shinjuku. 
Image credit: @the.cookie.tab Translated as “reverse chocolate”, gyaku choco refers to chocolate that’s given by men to women on Valentine’s Day. In other parts of the world, men and women exchange chocolates on Valentine’s regardless of gender, but in Japan, the women are usually the ones who give out chocolates on Valentine’s. 
Valentine’s Day became popular in Japan in the 1950s, due in part to a few notable business campaigns, particularly, a confectionary that began selling heart-shaped chocolates during the season, and a large department store that ran a “Valentine's Sale,” an idea that was followed by other department stores, and continues to this day. 
To this day, Valentine’s Day in Japan is celebrated by women giving men (lovers, friends, co-workers and bosses) chocolate. What kind of chocolate to give: the battle between cheap and classy In general, there are two types of chocolate: store-bought and homemade. 
Japan is one of the countries that has the most unique way to celebrate Valentine’s Day. In the land of cherry blossoms, February 14 th is the day exclusively for women to confess their feelings by giving chocolate to men. However, Japanese Valentine’s Day chocolate is not just a confession of love; it has many different types with many  
Men/people who received chocolate on Valentine’s Day are expected to return the favor by gifting chocolate to women/Valentine’s Day chocolate givers. White Day was not really a thing in Japan until the 1980s, and the color white is thought to be associated with purity, especially when it comes to innocent teenage love in Japanese culture. 
The rest is history, as come every Valentine’s Day, leading department stores and confectioneries in Japan dazzle their customers with a wide array of chocolate treats. Ladies are indeed spoilt for choice as the limitless availability of flavors, designs, shapes, and sizes empower them to choose the ideal gift that will satisfy their romantic  
The one thing about Valentine’s Day, in Japan, that is probably uncommon in other countries is that women give presents to men. The custom of a woman or girl giving chocolate as a gift to a man or boy that they like started around the 1950s in Japan. 
It is an uncommon gift on Valentine’s Day, as mehonmei choco are traditionally expected to reciprocate Valentine’s gifts a month later, on White Day.

The History of Valentine’s Day in Japan. Valentine's Day in Japan has evolved since it was first introduced in the 1950s. Western influence, particularly from the United States, played a crucial role in bringing this romantic holiday to Japan. However, the celebration didn’t take off in quite the same way as in the West. 
Valentine’s Day in Japan is very chocolate-centric. It is not as common to gift jewellery, teddy bears or flowers in Japan as it is to gift chocolate. This is probably due to the fact that Valentine’s Day began in Japan with high school students. 
The Japanese practice of women gifting sweets to men on Feb 14 can be traced to a specific event held in February 1958, when Mary Chocolate Co Ltd organized a special sales campaign at a department store in Shinjuku, Tokyo. As the practice took root in Japan over the ensuing decades, the market size continued swell, reaching an estimated 126 billion yen in 2019 before 
New Year’s Day is followed by Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day and Easter — a celebration for every month, but there weren’t any holidays in Japan then. So Japanese manufacturers saw one thing: an opening, a gap — and business potential. 
In most places celebrating Valentine’s Day, women can expect chocolates, flowers and a romantic dinner from their partner. However, in Japan, it’s the opposite: women give chocolates to the men in their lives—from their boyfriends to their coworkers—although not all chocolates are equal. The special men in their lives receive honmei choco, “true feeling” chocolates, while 
In Japan, women gift chocolate to men on Valentine’s Day Most of our readers will be familiar with the Western way of celebrating Valentine’s Day. Generally speaking, it’s a holiday where romantic partners either gift equally, or where the male gifts the female (that all depends on relationship dynamics).
