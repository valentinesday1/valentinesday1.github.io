        <h2><strong>valentines day was invented by hallmark ron swanson valentines day cedar falls iowa</strong></h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Hallmark did not invent Valentine’s Day. Initially, Hallmark’s founder, J.C. Hall , began selling Valentine’s Day postcards in 1910. As greeting cards gained popularity, Hallmark began printing its very own greeting cards. 
Valentine’s Day is fast approaching, and it’s often said that the greetings card company Hallmark invented the celebration in a ploy to sell cards. But is this really true? And if not, why do we celebrate romance on the 14th of February and who was Saint Valentine? Saint Valentine was a real person.

The first Valentine’s cards were made in the 18th century and were handmade and decorated with romantic symbols and poetry. The cards were slipped secretly under a door, or tied to a door-knocker for their loved one to find. 
But despite the big budget sensation, it’s not actually a so-called “Hallmark holiday,” invented merely to move merchandise. Its roots as a romantic occasion for lovers are more than 600 years 
Hallmark, which began offering Valentine's Day cards in 1913, estimates that today, 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are exchanged annually, not including the kids’ valentines popular for
