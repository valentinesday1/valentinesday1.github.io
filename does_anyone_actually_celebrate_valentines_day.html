        <h2><strong>does anyone actually celebrate valentines day happy valentines day cards for son</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine’s Day, also known as Saint Valentine’s Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, is celebrated annually on February 14. It is a day dedicated to love, romance, and affection, observed through exchanging greeting cards, flowers, chocolates, and gifts between loved ones. 
Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in  
Chocolate gifting became a Valentine’s Day staple thanks to Richard Cadbury’s invention of the heart-shaped chocolate box in the 1800s. Today, chocolates are one of the top gifts exchanged on Valentine’s Day, with everything from fancy truffles to giant chocolate bars making their way into hearts and hands. 
Valentine’s Day is the only holiday dedicated to celebrating a human emotion—love. While it is often associated with romance, it should be embraced as a broader celebration of love in all its  
Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It may have had beginnings in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which celebrated the coming of spring and included fertility rites and other activities, but the origin of the holiday is vague at best. 
People across the world celebrate their loved ones in commemoration of Valentine’s Day on Feb. 14 each year. However, people might not know why the holiday is so widely celebrated in the first place. There are several different stories surrounding the origins of Valentine’s Day, but the most recognized one follows the story of St. 
Valentine’s Day is celebrated on February 14 in most places, but some countries have multiple days to celebrate love throughout the year. For instance, Valentine’s Day, or Dia dos Namorados, is celebrated in Brazil on June 12 every year. This is in part because February’s Carnaval celebration is big enough that it eclipses Valentine’s  
Every year on Feb. 14, Americans celebrate Valentine's Day. The February holiday is set aside to let that special someone know how much they're cared about through gifts, flowers, greeting cards  
Why do we celebrate Valentine's Day today? Valentine's Day's transformation into a holiday about romantic love can be attributed to the Romantic English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. The Times notes that Jack B. Oruch, a late University of Kansas English professor, credits Chaucer for modern ideas about Valentine's Day. Through his research, Oruch  
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts  
Love is in the air, and people aren’t hesitating to splurge on their loved ones this Valentine’s Day.Consumers will spend a record $27.5 billion this holiday, an average of $188.81 per person  
100% this. Look after yourself - you obviously were looking forward to a "night off." You'll feel better if you do that for yourself - I'm not sure where you are and what your covid restrictions are, but even a takeaway coffee in a nice spot with a podcast or music or a book might do the job here. 
I'm going to propose we celebrate Discount Valentine's Day -- you go to the store a day or two after valentine's day and get discount flowers and chocolates, and celebrate the weekend after. It's great if you like valentine's day stuff but not necessarily the holiday 
My gf and I have been together for 3 1/2 years, we've not done anything for any Valentine's Day. This time it's even a Tuesday, wtf. However, if you think that just because someone doesn't celebrate Valentine's, that they don't make their gf happy Jeez, so American. We do tons of other stuff over the course of the year. 
Does anyone else and their significant other not celebrate Valentines day? I've been in a relationship with the same girl for over 5 years now and we have never once celebrated valentines day. Honestly, we both agree that it is the dumbest holiday our society celebrates. 
In elementary I was taught that Kwanzaa was one of the big three winter holidays along with Christmas and Hanukkah, but I've never heard anyone talk about it since, much less seen anyone celebrate it. I even thought it was a historical African holiday because my curriculum implied it was, until I found out it was founded in the 1960s in America. 
Anyway, does anyone out there have any Valentine's Day traditions that you do with your kids? I was thinking maybe doing a crafting project with my kid to make cards for each other, and maybe we could bake something. I definitely don't want to ignore the day, but I'm not ready to re-do Christmas lol. 
Me neither. I actually started taking myself out for valentines day a few years ago. If you can't treat anyone on the day, then treat yourself. Ironically I have a bf of a couple years, but his pet passed away on Valentine's day so we never got to spend V-Day. He still gets sad about it on that date, which is understandable. 
For the average person, a visit to a restaurant is few and far between. Doesn't take a big percentage of the population to celebrate valentine's for that day to drive up restaurant visits by a comparatively big amount. So you are both right: for the average Norwegian, valentine's doesn't matter. For a restaurant: it's still a huge day.
