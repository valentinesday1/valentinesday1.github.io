        <p>Many long-term couples like to surprise their significant other with gifts and love notes throughout the year, which means Valentine’s Day doesn’t always feel necessary. 
Those boring, mundane, day-to-day moments of life in between the magical ones those are the ones that matter to me. Source: ColorJoy Stock I’d gladly take someone who doesn’t show up with flowers on Valentine’s Day for someone who folds the laundry, who gets up in the middle of the night with our babies, who shows up day in and day out  
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
The pressure to pull off the perfect Valentine's Day can have you spending money you don't have on gifts your partner doesn't need. What's more, lack of communication between couples about what  
That. Instead of trying to cram all your love celebrations into one day, resolve to show love the rest of the year and take Valentine's Day off. Or better yet, turn it into a day of radical self-love. 
Here’s your Valentine’s Day streaming list, no matter how you feel about Valentine’s Day. To be truly climate-conscious, you should skip the winter flower bouquet. 
Single? Coupled up? Spending the day with friends? Doesn't matter—here are some fun Valentine's Day activities to do on February 14. 
Valentine’s Day is about your love for each other, not what your friends and family (and strangers) think about your relationship. References Gottman, J. M., &amp; Silver, N. (2015). 
Spending money on others—what psychologists call prosocial spending—can be a great way to use Valentine’s Day as a celebration of a broader kind of love, a love for humanity as a whole. 
Valentine’s Day encourages the idea that the occasional grand gesture of love (posh restaurant, flowers, and champagne on the 14th February, and, maybe, on birthdays and anniversaries) is what  
Tell him you do Valentine's Day, and it's important to you that he at least wish you a happy V-Day and accept your card. It doesn't matter that he doesn't see the day the same way that you do, it matters that he values the happiness the day brings you. 
Yeah. So it sounds like you think Valentine’s Day doesn’t matter in—  then Valentine’s Day doesn’t really feel important. I think it’s important for most people, because it makes us  
Okay, so I really want to spend Valentine’s Day with my girlfriend (of about 4 months) but she decided that she was going to accept plans with her two friends (male and female) instead of hanging out with me because the female friend didn’t want to be alone on Valentine’s day. 
P.F. Chang’s: The Asian bistro doesn't want your Valentine's Day dinner to be your last date. So when you dine between Feb. 13 and 18, you get a bounce-back offer for free dumplings to be  
Best Happy Valentine’s Day Quotes. The most memorable Valentine’s Day quotes are those that speak directly to the soul. A few simple words can ignite passion, strengthen bonds, and bring warmth to even the coldest days. Some quotes remind us of the power of love, while others add a touch of humor or nostalgia. 
This might bring some balance to Valentine’s Day, which still doesn’t have much going for it anyway. In China, there’s a holiday for single people called Singles’ Day , celebrated on Nov. 11, which isn’t ideal for obvious reasons in Canada, but it would be great if Canada adopted a similar holiday. 
JEMIMA CAINER: Valentine's Day doesn't always hold astrological significance. Every year, the chart for any given day. But, today messenger planet Mercury moves into sensitive Pisces. 
Last-minute reservations can be hard to find on the eve of Valentine’s Day. But those living in London are lucky to have a thriving restaurant scene and diverse options. The city also has a  
Many people hate Valentine's Day because it reminds them of being single. To this I ask, why is Valentine's Day celebrated? It is to celebrate love. This doesn't necessarily mean romantic love. You can still celebrate the love of your family, your friends, and even yourself. If you feel sad and lonely on Valentine's Day, treat yourself. 
I asked him, two to three weeks ago, to plan something for Valentine’s Day. I asked him almost every day if he had planned anything. I had gotten a babysitter for my son then, and was just going to update on time. That’s all. And he never gave me an update because he didn’t plan anything. </p>
