        <p>Valentine’s Day in the Age of Capitalism. Today, Valentine’s Day is a multi-billion-dollar industry. It is no longer just about expressing love—it is about spending. The holiday has been carefully crafted by marketers to encourage consumers to buy everything from chocolates and flowers to fine jewelry and luxury experiences. 
Feb. 14 — good ol’ Valentine’s Day. The day of love and, for many, expressing that love. Shelves decked out in shades of pink and red. Heart-shaped boxes of chocolates — the de facto gift. 
1835 – 60,000 Valentine’s Day cards are sent in the UK. Even though sending letters and cards through the post was expensive in the UK at this time, 60,000 Valentine’s Day cards were sent. The custom of sending cards had become so popular that they were now produced in factories and decorated with fabric and lace. 
Valentine's Day evolved significantly during the Industrial Revolution, transitioning from handmade to mass-produced greeting cards. By the 1850s, manufactured cards dominated, with over a million  
Valentine's Day 2025:Where to get heart-shaped pizza, doughnuts, nuggets and more food When is Valentine's Day? Valentine's Day is always on February 14th. In 2025, the holiday just so happens to  
According to Kelly, author of “Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine,” the English writer was the first to make the connection to love — but he was talking about another St. Valentine whose feast day was May 3. To commemorate King Richard II’s engagement on that day in 1381, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a love poem. 
Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air. The price of cocoa beans is setting unprecedented records on the commodities market and it will certainly turn the gift of love into a bigger financial commitment than it once was. 
In the mid-80’s the chocolate, flowers, and jewellery industries got involved, and by 2009 the US made approximately £9.2 billion in Valentine’s Day retail. So basically, Valentine’s Day is an opportunity for the big fat companies to get bigger and fatter, by making single people bigger and fatter when they stock up on the 15th of  
Chaucer can therefore be described as the person who ushered in the romantic celebration of Valentine’s Day. He was the bridge between the martyrdom of the past and the capitalism-driven Valentine’s Day celebration of today. Another very interesting poem that helped to transform the theme of Valentine’s Day came from Charles, Duke of Orleans. 
Is Valentine’s Day outdated? Let’s go back to the beginning. The exact history of this day is quite cloudy, but can be traced back to the third century when St. Valentine (the name of one or two Christian martyrs) died. According to legend, St. Valentine was a priest who was marrying Christian couples in secret. 
On Valentine’s Day, we should celebrate capitalism not only for the prosperity it creates, but for the many ways in which it fosters and validates friendships, enriching the vast array of  
That is the love we must embody, not the individualist and consumerist hell of the capitalists. That is the world where Valentine’s Day is every day. We can embody this collective love, each and every day, by struggling for the radical new world where love is everywhere. May your roses be plentiful and collective. Happy Valentine’s Day.

Penetration of the celebration of Valentine's Day across many cultures in the world is something that capitalism can cherish. With the global expansion of capitalism in the fastest ever speed, especially after the fall of USSR and liberalization in China, globalization of Euro-America centric culture is happening in further greater pace. 
Valentine’s Day is a celebration of “romantic love” that, like Christmas, serves as an economic boom for a capitalist retail industry. As to be expected under capitalism, this love is  
Create a show-stopping moment with a classic Valentine’s Day symbol — a heart with an arrow through it. Symbolizing love, this jumbo heart, made by A Beautiful Mess, is the perfect backdrop for a romantic dinner for two. But if you’re hosting a larger gathering, it’ll make a dramatic photo backdrop. 
“The magic of holidays like Valentine’s day is that it is really up for interpretation and can be celebrated in a number of ways,” said Magner. All of the students interviewed agreed that the most valuable gift on Valentine’s Day is spending time with their loved ones. 
Holidays are capitalist days of overconsumption. For Valentine’s Day, stores rolled out their heart-shaped candies, roses and stuffed animals. Typically, products produced for holidays end up in landfills. People spend roughly $27 billion for Valentine’s Day — which doesn’t even come close to Christmas spending. 
Valentine’s Day, February 14th is here, again. The day of love is celebrated all over the world, especially in America. Since I moved to Spain, the only thing I noticed during February was the  </p>
