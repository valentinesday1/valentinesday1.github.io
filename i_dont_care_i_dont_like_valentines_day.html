        <h2><strong>i dont care i dont like valentines day valentines day baby and mom</strong></h2>
        <p>Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
Making an effort on Valentine's Day is great if you're SO is into it, but if you don't it doesn't mean you don't care about them. The same argument could be made in the reverse. If someone demands stuff on Valentines Day then they don't care about the person who doesn't want to celebrate it. That's why that's flawed logic. 
53. Valentine’s Day is overrated, but you’re still stuck with me—lucky you! 54. I may not be into Valentine’s Day, but I’ll always be into you. ️. 55. Valentine’s Day is for the  
Pontificate in Shakespearean English: Counteract the dumbness of the day with some pretentious fancy-talk: If all else fails, make your own book jacket: Then throw it at whatever dummiez persist in annoying you about Valentine’s Day: 
If your boo would rather die of 1,000 paper cuts than take a romantic horse and carriage ride or go to a fancy restaurant on Valentine's Day, think of celebrating with low-key things you both  
It’s all about flowers, chocolates, elegant dinners and romantic gestures for many people. For me though I simply don’t give a damn. Perhaps this is how you’ve felt or perhaps you’re simply wondering why so many people seem to value a holiday. Here’s why I dont care about valentines day and I’m sticking to it. 
Don't get me wrong: Just because I am not down with Valentine's Day, doesn't mean I don't love, well, love. I really do. But I believe in loving on my own terms and in my own way. 
However, our first Valentine’s Day together didn’t feel any more special than any other day. He always showered me with love and affection , so V-Day just didn’t seem to be such a big deal  
32 Valentine’s wishes for coworkers. When you spend 40-plus hours a week with people, they basically become your work-family. And while Valentine’s Day might not be an official office holiday, it’s still a great excuse to send some appreciation to the people who make your 9-to-5 a little more bearable. 
Cahleb Derry has spent only one Valentine’s Day with a romantic partner, and he has naturally dissociated the holiday from its romantic associations. “I think it’s so important to ‘date  
I don't care about valentine's day, but I usually cook something nice because I like to cook and its a good reason as any to make something fancier than I normally would. But fuck those convenience store bouquets of carnations and shitty red boxes of chocolates. 
Like, if you actually lay it out, between birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, Valentine's Day, I'm seriously buying her a present or planning an elaborate date every 6 weeks." Advertisement 11. 
Valentine's Day: a celebration of love, affection, and all things heart-shaped. Yet, some folks treat it like a root canal appointment. I don't get it. It's a day dedicated to love! What's not to adore? A recent study revealed that Massachusetts ranked among the top 20 states dreading Valentine's 
For me, I don't really care about valentine's day. But the most important thing to me for special occasions is just to spend time with my SO. Since you unfortunately won't be able to be with her on that day, I'd have something or other delivered so she knows you're thinking of her and wish that you could be together. Plan your OWN valentine's day. 
We don't care for Valentines day. I told him I don't like flowers and any stuffed animal will be trashed. We celebrated it once and it wasn't that different from our usual dates. We enjoyed our time but it wasn't because of it being Valentines day. We do look forward to the clearance candies though hahahaha 
I don't think I've ever celebrated Valentine's Day, even on those rare occasions where I have been in a relationship in February. It's just a day friend, don't get too hung up on it. Plenty of women (and men) get well into their 20s before having their first serious relationship. Just because you are single doesn't mean you have to be alone. 
If you don't care about gifts but you're whining about the gifts but its not about the gifts BUT Valentine's Day is important to you then how exactly is Valentine's Day important to you if it's not about the gifts? Does that make sense? I get he lied about not having money but you do seem like you're making it about the gifts a little. 
Romantic Valentine’s Day Messages "Every day with you feels like Valentine’s Day. But today, I get an excuse to spoil you even more." "I never believed in soulmates until I met you. Now, I can’t imagine my life without you." "You are my greatest love story, and I can’t wait to keep writing it with you." 
For info, I don't hate Valentines day, I just don't care at all It's a day to remind you and your SO of the love you share and that is something you should celebrate however you want This is a problem for me, why would you need a special day to show the love you have to your SO, isn't it the point to be with her/him that you love her/him 
Been "officially" single for about 8 years now. I actually left my ex after Valentines Day (for several reasons, and was finally fed up). But generally, Valentine's means little to me. I don't need one day to do the things that we should be doing on any day of the year. </p>
