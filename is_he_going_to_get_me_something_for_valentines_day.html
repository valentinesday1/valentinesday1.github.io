Anyways, I‚Äôm not a Valentine‚Äôs Day guy at ALL. I don‚Äôt think she is either. It actually didn‚Äôt cross my mind until I saw the calendar. She‚Äôs very sweet, but also she‚Äôs admitted she needs a lot of time before things went anywhere (first kiss, sex, etc). Fine with me. I‚Äôm mostly wondering - should I get her something? 
I asked him, two to three weeks ago, to plan something for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I asked him almost every day if he had planned anything. I had gotten a babysitter for my son then, and was just going to update on time. That‚Äôs all. And he never gave me an update because he didn‚Äôt plan anything. 
I didn‚Äôt only get him the gift because I expected one in return. I was excited to see his reaction to the necklace and I wanted to get him something he can wear and think about me when he looks at. I know the way I put it sounds like I am being selfish but it‚Äôs the fact that he didn‚Äôt seem like he felt bad for not doing anything. 
Do not many girls think they should get something for their boyfriends on Valentine's day? My ex would keep asking me before Valentine's what I was going to get her before Valentine and she rolls in without any gifts expecting that I'll still give her mine 
Usually for Valentine‚Äôs Day I‚Äôd send him a huge package with all kinds of LDR themed gifts, but I‚Äôm at a total loss for this year. I still want to get him something because I get him something every year and he‚Äôs probably going to get me something. What do you even boy your boyfriend, who you see every day, for Valentine‚Äôs Day? 
Get him something romantic, something fun, and something practical. Like 3 separate things not something that fits all those categories lol Romantic: If this could be an ‚Äúextra special trip‚Äù üíç you can‚Äôt go wrong with something sexy for you to wear back in the hotel. 
valentine's day is one of the dumbest holidays. i was never a fan of giving or receiving gifts and the like in general, so i wouldn't do anything for my partner and i wouldn't want him to do anything for me and i would refuse any gift unless he absolutely insisted on giving me one and was totally fine with not getting anything back. i do the  
He decided what to get me the the night before Valentines, after seeing how disappointed I was. I‚Äôm okay with receiving his gift the day after valentines, I just wish that he would have planned it earlier (like I did for his gift. It‚Äôs nit that hard.). I wonder, if we hadn‚Äôt talked about it would he have gotten me nothing at all 
This could just be me, but my MIL gets upset if my husband doesn‚Äôt give her anything for Valentine‚Äôs Day or carve out time to go see her on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Mind you, she has a husband who showers her in gifts and attention. Growing up, I always thought of Valentine‚Äôs Day as something romantic. 
If we go with the one day he‚Äôs gonna be gone theory, maybe she‚Äôd like one day he‚Äôs gonna be gone and every time Valentine‚Äôs Day comes around she remembers how he did this particularly sweet thing for her on that day IN ADDITION TO making her feel loved the other 364 days. </p>
