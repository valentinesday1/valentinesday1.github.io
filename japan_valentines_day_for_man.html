        <p>Japan also observes a unique reciprocal holiday on March 14th, known as White Day, where men return the favour to those who gifted them chocolates on Valentine’s Day. This was created by the confectionery industry in the late 1970s and has since become a firmly established part of our Valentine’s Day cycle. 
White Day was not actually established until the 1980s, when the Japanese National Confectionery Industry Association successfully campaigned to implement a ‘reply day’ for men to reciprocate the presents they received from women on St. Valentine’s. 
White Day in Japan (March 14th) Now, if you were thinking, “that’s a little unfair that the guys get all the gifts!” – don’t worry, because just a month later, on March 14th is when men are supposed to reciprocate all the love they received on Valentine’s Day. 
The next year, they promoted the idea that “women give chocolates to men.” In the 1960s, the confectionery company Morinaga started selling more chocolates during Valentine’s season. Over time, this idea became popular, and women giving chocolates on Valentine’s Day in Japan became a common tradition. 
Men/people who received chocolate on Valentine’s Day are expected to return the favor by gifting chocolate to women/Valentine’s Day chocolate givers. White Day was not really a thing in Japan until the 1980s, and the color white is thought to be associated with purity, especially when it comes to innocent teenage love in Japanese culture. 
Valentine’s Day is known as the day when one expresses their love to that one special person. In Western countries it is common for both men and women to participate in a gift exchange. Often, the approaching date of February 14th causes men across the world to scramble, trying to pick out a gift, or plan the perfect date. However, in Japan, Valentine’s Day plays out a bit differently  
As a matter of fact, Valentine's Day in Japan takes place in two steps: Valentine's Day (on February 14, initiated around 1958, by the confectionary brand Morinaga 森永); White Day (on March 14, a month later, initiated during the 1970's). Valentine's Day : gifts from women to men 
The way Valentine’s Day is celebrated in Japan — initially beginning as a day for women to offer boxes of chocolates to men they have feelings for — is evolving with the rising prices of  
That’s right — in Japan, Valentine’s Day is all about women giving chocolate to men. It’s a strong tradition that dates back to the 1950s. That doesn’t mean men can sit back and enjoy the sentiment, though. 
In most places celebrating Valentine’s Day, women can expect chocolates, flowers and a romantic dinner from their partner. However, in Japan, it’s the opposite: women give chocolates to the men in their lives—from their boyfriends to their coworkers—although not all chocolates are equal. The special men in their lives receive honmei choco, “true feeling” chocolates, while 
The Japanese practice of women gifting sweets to men on Feb 14 can be traced to a specific event held in February 1958, when Mary Chocolate Co Ltd organized a special sales campaign at a department store in Shinjuku, Tokyo. As the practice took root in Japan over the ensuing decades, the market size continued swell, reaching an estimated 126 billion yen in 2019 before 
In Japan, women gift chocolate to men on Valentine’s Day. Most of our readers will be familiar with the Western way of celebrating Valentine’s Day. Generally speaking, it’s a holiday where romantic partners either gift equally, or where the male gifts the female (that all depends on relationship dynamics). 
Take notes from these Japanese men on choosing the perfect Valentine's Day gift! It’s no secret that Valentine’s Day in Japan is celebrated differently from the rest of the world. Instead of men and women exchanging gifts, women give chocolates and presents to men on February 14th, and men  
it can be an extension of girichoco (obligation chocolate) but generally uncommon since white day is male giving equivalent. I wouldn't say forbidden, especially if you're not Japanese - male coworkers or friends would probably just laugh &amp; thank you for the chocolates, or try to explain Valentine's vs. White day to you. 
True fact: In the 1980s the Japanese National Confectionery Industry Association launched a successful campaign to make March 14th a “reply day”, where men are expected to return the favor to those who gave them chocolates on Valentine’s Day, calling it White Day for the color of the chocolates being offered. 
The holiday gained popularity in Japan around 1958, but it was in the late 1970s that Valentine’s Day became a part of Japanese society. The “Japanese-style Valentine’s Day” also emerged, where women express affection by giving chocolates to men. 
In Japan, it is only the women who give presents (mainly chocolates) to men on Valentine's Day. Learn more about how the Japanese celebrate the day of love. 
White Day: a month later, men respond The origins of White Day. White Day was established in 1978 by a Japanese confectionery company, eager to create a "return" to Valentine's Day. 
White Day was first celebrated in 1978 in Japan. [2] The National Confectionery Industry Association started it as an "answer day" to Valentine's Day on the grounds that men should pay back the women who gave them chocolate and other gifts on Valentine's Day.
