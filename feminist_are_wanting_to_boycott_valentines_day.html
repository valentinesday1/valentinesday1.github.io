The holiday perpetuates highly gendered stereotypes; boyfriends are supposed to buy their girlfriends flowers, pick them up, and pay for their dinner. Working and driving are two things that women fought

Feminism and Valentine’s Day, it’s that ongoing debate about whether as modern women we should even be celebrating such an outdated event. Gender roles and old fashioned mindsets have made

Ethical, sustainable and fair trade chocolate is the perfect Valentine’s Day gift. We rate 84 brands of chocolate, and give our recommendations and highlight ones to avoid.
