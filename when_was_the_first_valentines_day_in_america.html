"In 1847, Esther Howland of Worcester, Massachusetts, first introduced Valentine's Day to the American public and the rest, as they say, is history," according to historic-uk.com. 
Contrary to popular belief, Hallmark did not invent Valentine’s Day. Initially, Hallmark’s founder, J.C. Hall, began selling Valentine’s Day postcards in 1910. As greeting cards gained popularity, Hallmark began printing its very own greeting cards. By 1916, the very first Hallmark Valentine’s Day cards appeared on store shelves.

Esther A. Howland, an American, is often credited with creating the first commercial Valentine’s Day cards in the 1840s. Why are roses associated with this day? Roses have been associated with love and beauty in various cultures for centuries. 
And sometimes the Valentine’s Day pair would marry. In the Dutch colonies in the1600s and early 1700s, it was widely held that on the morning of Saint Valentine’s Day, the first man a woman would set eyes on, or vice versa, should be that gentleman’s or lady’s intend-ed, and accompany her throughout the day.
