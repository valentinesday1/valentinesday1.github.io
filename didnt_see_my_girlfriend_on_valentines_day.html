        <h2><strong>didnt see my girlfriend on valentines day valentines day projects school</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
Remember, not everyone celebrates Valentine's Day the same way. Some people aren't into the commercialization of love and prefer to show their affection at other times of the year. So, if your partner doesn't give you a gift on February 14th, it might mean they don't see this date as significant. 
An entire day dedicated to declaring your love for someone? If you’re casually hooking up or in a new relationship, Valentine’s Day can be awkward. The reality is you may not be ready to write each other mushy cards, spend money on an expensive dinner, or say “I love you,” if you’re not at a full blown BF/GF status. 
Maybe he forgot. I say this because my girlfriend told me Happy Valentine’s Day today and I responded with “haha oh yeah, I forgot.” It’s not a big deal to a lot of people. I can’t stand this day. Unnecessary traffic everywhere. So maybe he doesn’t even like Valentine’s Day. Perhaps you could ask him what he thinks about  
Okay, so I really want to spend Valentine’s Day with my girlfriend (of about 4 months) but she decided that she was going to accept plans with her two friends (male and female) instead of hanging out with me because the female friend didn’t want to be alone on Valentine’s day. Which of course, leaves me alone. 
I am the more masculine one in the relationship and she does tend to treat me more like a man, where she doesn’t give me much reassurance, no valentine’s day gift, makes me come see her, etc. I know I could just tell her how I feel but I feel like I’ve been explaining a lot of things that make me upset lately and i’m just scared to add on. 
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
On Valentine’s Day, your partner didn’t provide what you hoped would happen, and I think couples often have disagreements when expectations aren’t fulfilled. It’s easy to assume that a  
February is a month of love, where lovers express affection towards each other. Dates on Valentine's Day are always romantic and lovely, but something can go wrong sometime. These people share how they witnessed Valentine’s Day relationships fails. 
Some people truly hate Valentine's Day. Unfortunately, some of them may end up in relationships with people who expect them to celebrate it. Both partners can be happy if they are both willing to  
My (24M) girlfriend (26F) didnt get me anything for valentines day I have been seeing this girl for 6 months, official for only about a month. She is tight on cash right now, but is about to be in a better financial position, I don't mind though so I help with groceries, dog food and other odds and ends. 
I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
Maybe he forgot. I say this because my girlfriend told me Happy Valentine’s Day today and I responded with “haha oh yeah, I forgot.” It’s not a big deal to a lot of people. I can’t stand this day. Unnecessary traffic everywhere. So maybe he doesn’t even like Valentine’s Day. Perhaps you could ask him what he thinks about  
That's your own damn fault. It's just a day. Not even your anniversary. Me and my gf didn't even bring up that it's Valentines day. anything I said just sounded selfish when I put it into words. Not selfish, but childish. 
Happy Valentine's Day, friend! It's really unfortunate that he didn't at least say the words to you :(. There's nothing wrong with you! It's been a common thread on this sub today that some boyfriends "don't believe in Valentines Day" or "won't celebrate [it]". This could be the case! 
"You are the highlight of my day, every day." "I can’t wait to hold you in my arms tonight." "You make my heart feel lighter and my days brighter." "Every day with you feels like Valentine’s Day." "I love the way you make me feel." "You’re the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing before I sleep." 
It's easy to feel a bit bummed or even overlooked if you were expecting a little something and it didn't happen, especially on a day like Valentine's Day, which is all about expressing affection. But here's the deal: not everyone views Valentine's Day with the same level of importance, and it doesn't necessarily reflect how she feels about you. 
My current ex gf she meant a lot to me so I did just that but she ended up doing the same exact thing I did to her to me in a way it was just insane I didn’t know how to process it in a way if she was still hurting about my situation with my old ex I wish she only told me so I can reassure her that I love her but she never wanted to listen to  
So we have been together for 2 years now. My boyfriend couldn't remember our anniversary date so I said, doesn't matter, even better. You do something nice and romantic on valentines day and I'll do something nice on our anniversary (which happens a month after valentines day). 
Male 23 here. First time I got a girlfriend. We live in a long distance relationship. I have never cared about valentine's. I didn't pick up on obvious hints that she really cared about it. She is mad at me because I didn't write here a valentine's message. I told here that I think valentine's day is kinda lame. Then she got even mader. </p>
