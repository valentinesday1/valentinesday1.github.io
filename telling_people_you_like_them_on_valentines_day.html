Regardless of the strategy you choose, the basis of real interactions is genuineness, so put honesty and sincerity first. Valentine’s Day is a great opportunity to tell someone you love them and gives you a chance to communicate from the heart. 
My niece is telling people how to celebrate Valentine's Day which is to stop buying cut flowers and greeting cards. I will buy cut flowers and greeting cards, because I wish to. I don't really believe I owe the world any explanation. 
Give your child a "Get out of Jail Free Card" for Valentine's Day that he can redeem when he doesn't do a chore that he was supposed to do — no scolding allowed!

Uncommunicated expectations are premeditated resentments. How can someone know what you expect and rise to meet expectations if you never tell them what you expect? Right?? Guys are just clueless.

You look beautiful today, just like every day. You always know the right thing to say to make me smile. I had a bad day, but as soon as I saw you, I cheered right up. I miss you when you're not here. You make my day complete. You are the smartest person. (Substitute smartest with any positive adjective you like.) You're so funny. 
Go tell someone you love them!  In your own secret language. I made a Valentine's Day gift card that is also a cipher wheel, so that you can declare your love in a secret message! All you need is scissors and a split pin. Along with the card, this PDF includes 3 Valentine's Day themed gift boxes: a pillow box, a cube and a pyramid. 
If you’re too shy to tell your crush that you like them in person, you could write them a note. Keep it short, simple, and to the point. Explain your feelings, but don’t include too many gushy details. </p>
