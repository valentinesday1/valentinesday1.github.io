        <p>If you're not feeling all bright and shiny about everything Cupid, then you're going to love these eight reasons why Valentine's Day is actually toxic AF, and why you're empowered to avoid it. 
The holiday of love is not only costly to celebrate but can leave many people disappointed. Here are eight reasons why Valentine's Day is the worst. 
Valentine's Day itself does not get a lot of love in the scientific literature, but a few scattered studies hint at why it inspires hate. See if any of the reasons to hate Valentine's Day ring true 
But the origins of this festival of candy and cupids are actually dark, bloody — and a bit muddled. Though no one has pinpointed the exact origin of the holiday, one place to start is ancient Rome. 
Are you dreading Valentine's Day? Here's the science of what makes us dislike it and what we can do to make ourselves happy this holiday (and every other day, too). 
Here are all the reasons why. 1. It's too expensive. Chocolate, steak, and alcohol are all marked up by 300 percent (or something) just because retailers and restaurants know that consumers 
If happiness is the distance between expectation and reality, Valentine’s Day sets up many couples to be disappointed. Big time. Think about the hype. Valentine’s has become a holiday on 
Valentine’s Day has inspired its own insurgency, “Singles Awareness Day,” in which the unattached celebrate their solitude with a saucy “Happy SAD day.” Any holiday that triggers guerrilla 
According to Dee's data, of the 5,000+ unhappy couples she has worked with, she says that 'almost 100 per cent' did not celebrate, or even acknowledge Valentine's Day. I think the key takeaway from the data is the term 'unhappy couples'. They were ALREADY unhappy, and I doubt a lack of gifting on Valentine's Day was the primary issue. 
One of the primary reasons Valentine's Day can be detrimental to our mental health is the societal pressure to create a perfect romantic experience. From elaborate dates to expensive gifts, the day is often portrayed as a benchmark for measuring the depth of one's love. 
Valentine’s Day only exists in its modern form to sell cards and chocolates at an otherwise slow time of the year. We really don’t have any other major holidays between Christmas/New Year’s and Easter (yes St Patrick’s Day but you don’t really buy gifts/candy as much for that) 
Valentine’s Day jokes are a fun way to spread laughter and love on February 14th. This collection of 110 funny Valentine’s Day jokes includes puns, one-liners, and witty remarks suitable for kids and adults alike. Funny Valentine’s Day Puns. Valentine’s Day puns are a clever way to show affection with a touch of humor. 
Best Funny Valentine’s Day Quotes. Love is a beautiful thing, but it also comes with its fair share of laughter. Some of the best Valentine’s Day quotes poke fun at relationships, romance, and all the quirks that come with being in love. 
That’s right. I hate Valentine’s Day. So I’d like to take this moment to express my feelings about my least favorite holiday of the year. Maybe you will also agree that Valentines day is stupid too. Roses are red, Violets are blue, Cupid is a jerk, and Valentine's Day sucks. Save the flowers for my funeral! Here's why Valentines Day is  
Valentine’s Day is built on the life of a Christian saint and people are talking about sex and seduction props to celebrate it, which is so far from being religious or spiritual, I have no idea why they waste their time celebrating it at all. 
Valentine's Day is stupid and pointless and absurd if you take it too seriously or place too much importance on it. That's where the problem is. Some people put way too much weight on it. There's no reason Valentine's Day can't just be some fun silly holiday that everybody can enjoy. I actually enjoy it more when I'm single! 
The even bigger problem: it is far too commercial. Flowers, food, cards and (very) expensive gifts. If you want to do something for Valentine's Day, you are actually expected to spend (a lot of) money. Valentine's Day is no longer about showing your love, but about buying (and for shops: selling) goods.
