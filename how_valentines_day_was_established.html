Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts.

Advanced American technologies meant that more elaborate cards were produced cheaply, encouraging their popularity yet  
Long before Valentine's Day was recognized as a holiday, the Romans held an annual festival called Lupercalia. Celebrated between February 13 and 15, Lupercalia was a pagan fertility festival

What is Valentines Day? Valentine’s Day, a day dedicated to love and affection, has a rich and fascinating history. Its origins can be traced back to ancient Roman festivals, but it was during the medieval period that it became associated with romance. The exchange of handwritten letters, or “valentines,” became a popular tradition  
The Catholic Church might have established St. Valentine's Day to honor these two martyrs. Legend says that one of these men, Saint Valentine of Terni, had officiated weddings for Roman soldiers in secret, going against the emperor's wishes, making him seen to some as a proponent of love. 
Valentine’s Day is the day of love. On February 14, more than any other day of the year, romantic couples shower their better half with gifts and tokens of appreciation. Much about Valentine’s  
Saint Valentine’s Day was established in order to replace the old pagan ways. If some of the strange pagan marriage and fertility traditions persisted, recall that  
Some believe Valentine’s Day is celebrated in mid-February to mark St. Valentine’s death around the year 270. Others think the church chose this date to replace the ancient Roman festival Lupercalia, held on February 15, which honoured the god of agriculture, Faunus, and the legendary founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus. 
This culminated in 496 AD when Pope Gelasius I officially established February 14 as St. Valentine's Day, honoring a Christian martyr known for performing secret marriages and showing compassion in defiance of Roman law (History, 2025). 
There were multiple St. Valentines (including decapitated ones), but it was a medieval poet who first established the holiday's romantic tradition.

While the Roman Catholic Church honors St. Valentine on February 14, the Eastern Orthodox celebrates St. Valentine’s Day on July 6 2. </p>
