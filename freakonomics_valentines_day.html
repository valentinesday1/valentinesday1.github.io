        <p>Who says there’s no romance in macroeconomics? Betsey Stevenson and I are currently working on a paper for a forthcoming Brookings Panel, assessing the relationship between levels of economic development and various measures of subjective well-being. We are working with an absolutely fabulous data set: the Gallup World Poll. The good folks at Gallup are now surveying people in more . . . 
valentine's day - Freakonomics. What You Don’t Know About Online Dating. Season 6, Episode 23 On this week’s episode of Freakonomics Radio: an economist’s guide to dating online. 
I would love to see a chart-of-the-day calendar of econo-wonky goodness. And if you enjoyed this, you might also enjoy some of Elisabeth’s past work, including: Statistical Insights into the Typical University of Chicago Student; Pomona in 47 Charts (her undergraduate alma mater) I am Tired of Giving You the Same Advice; Happy Valentine’s Day! 
And while Hallmark did not invent the occasion, it played a big part in bolstering its popularity by selling Valentine’s Day postcards in 1910, and then printing its own greetings cards from 1916. 
According to a new survey, the generation that adores flashy, TikTok-ready prom-posals and gender-reveal parties will shell out the most for love this Valentine's Day. 
Steven D. Levitt and Steven J. Dubner's Freakonomics doesn't so much explore the hidden side of everything as  Thanksgiving, and Valentine's Day all show lower pay rates than their July 4th and  
People were complaining in women’s magazines in the late 19th century that Valentine’s Day was too commercial. “Everybody’s always expecting Valentine’s Day to die out, and it never does,” she said. “It’s sort of like saying, ‘Coney Island’s too crowded. Nobody goes there anymore.’” 
From boxes of chocolate and candy hearts to floral bouquets and more, shoppers are ready to celebrate love this Valentine’s Day. The latest study from NRF and Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics found that total spending on the holiday is expected to reach a record $27.5 billion and that more people are planning to participate in the holiday compared with last year. 
Here’s your Valentine’s Day streaming list, no matter how you feel about Valentine’s Day. To be truly climate-conscious, you should skip the winter flower bouquet. 
Roses are nice but money we exalt; Be my Valentine and you get the (gold) vault. (econlife) Our Bottom Line: An Economist’s Valentine Facts. The National Retail Federation tells us that for Valentine’s Day, a typical man will spend $291.15 and a woman, $106.22 Averaging $196.31 for all of us, the total is up 21 percent from last year.

Episode 80 Riding the Herd Mentality. How using peer pressure — and good, old-fashioned shame — can push people to do the right thing. 
Thanksgiving is nearly as bad; the week of Valentine's Day is also lousy, as is the week straddling April 15. There are, however, a few good holidays: the weeks that include the Fourth of July, Labor Day, and Columbus Day. The difference in the two sets of holidays? The low-cheating holidays represent little more than an extra day off from work. 
Finally, Mike and Angela reminisce about high-school Valentine’s Day fundraisers in which students could send one another flowers. They guess that carnations were commonly used for this tradition because of how cheap they are to buy in bulk. 
DUCKWORTH: My husband Jason sent me an op-ed from The New York Times that was published I think the day before Valentine’s Day. The title is some version of “Have More Sex, Please!” And the perspective offered — provocative — is that we should be having more sex. 
This was around Valentine’s Day. GRZELAK: And I had been single for a while and thought hey, maybe I’ll be able to date an NPR employee because that’s whose profiles they were looking at on the show. The very day she hears this episode, Mandi Grzelak decides to sign up for online dating. 
This reminds me — in high school, we used to have this Valentine’s Day fund-raiser every year, and you could send carnations to someone, right? MAUGHAN: Yes! Okay, I was going to say, that’s what we did, too. It’s always carnations. DUCKWORTH: It’s always carnations, because they’re so cheap. MAUGHAN: Dime a dozen, yeah. DUCKWORTH
