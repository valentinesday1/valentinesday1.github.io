        <h2><strong>greek mythology valentines day knock knock jokes for valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Some scholars trace Valentine’s Day back to ancient Greece and the mythical green meadows of Arcadia in the Peloponnese. Credit: Public Domain. A modern big business holiday, Valentine’s Day for many means jewelry, flowers, heart-shaped chocolate and candy, and lots of TLC. But it wasn’t always like that. 
Countless love stories are found in Ancient Greek myths, often with tragic endings. Of those, in celebration of Valentine’s Day, we have selected three that can turn even the most cynical among you into hopeless romantics. Enjoy! 1. Psyche and Eros 
Greek Mythology had a major influence on Valentine's Day from Aphrodite's rose to Eros becoming Cupid. 
We think of Valentine’s Day as a Christian holiday, but the truth is that the roots and many of its symbols were borrowed from the Romans, and they borrowed most of their ideas and stories from the Greeks. Two of the most easily recognized symbols of Valentine’s Day are the heart shape and Cupid. 
St. Valentine's Day originated in ancient Greece as the Festival of the Arcadian Lykaia but who was St. Valentine and where are his relics? 
Although there is no evidence linking Saint Valentine’s Day to the rites of the ancient Roman or ancient Greek cults, popular modern sources claim links to the Roman Lupercalia celebration observed around February 13–15, a rite connected to fertility. 
Though Cupid is traced back to Greek and Roman mythology, here's how the icon of Valentine's Day went from a handsome god to a child. 
Each year on February 14, romantic partners exchange affectionate cards and sugary-sweet chocolates, all in the name of St. Valentine — and all while the iconic image of Cupid takes center stage. But who are these figures, and how did they converge for this sentimental holiday? 
In 1994, the then spokesman of the Holy Synod, Giannis Hatzifotis, proposed that the feast of Saint Hyacinth, which is celebrated on July 3, be established as Valentine’s Day. Hyacinth originated in Caesarea, Cappadocia, and served the Roman emperor Trajan’s Column. 
This week will see millions of people in Greece and across the world buy red roses, make hurried restaurant reservations and send candy sales through the roof as they celebrate St. Valentine’s Day — the annual feast of love and romance. 
We think of Valentine’s Day as a Christian holiday, but the truth is that the roots and many of its symbols were borrowed from the Romans, and they borrowed most of their ideas and stories from the Greeks. Two of the most easily recognized symbols of Valentine’s Day are the heart shape and Cupid. 
Shakespeare also considered Valentine’s Day a day for lovers, and associated Cupid with love. By the 16th century, Valentine’s Day and Cupid were established cultural symbols of love, and they eventually coalesced on greeting cards. At this time, cards were enormously popular across Europe, Valentine’s cards chief among them. 
Their tale transcends time and embodies the true mystical and mythological nature of Valentine’s Day. Greek god Eros (who’s Roman counterpart was Cupid) was the winged god of love and passion, who, depending on his mood, would mischievously shoot his arrows at others to create amorous and hateful relationships. 
Valentine Cupid is one of the popular Valentine's Day characters. Here's what to know about this chubby mythical matchmaker.  Eros, too, is depicted as a winged creature in Greek mythology  
How Valentine’s Day Evolved . 3rd century AD – A priest named Valentine of Rome was martyred on February 14th, 269 AD. Other martyrs named Valentine also existed during that period. 5th century AD – Pope Gelasius I established February 14th as Saint Valentine’s Feast Day to honour these martyrs.

But apart from the small god of Greek mythology who plays a role in the evolution of this foreign-brought celebration, are there any other aspects of St. Valentine’s Day that could be possibly associated with Greece or Greek culture? First of all, the story hidden behind the most identifying love symbol is of Greek origin. 
Who is Cupid Greek mythology and Roman mythology? Cupid dates all the way back to Greek and Roman mythology. While it is hard to find the exact date that Greek mythology began, it was depicted in art during the Geometric Period (900 B.C.E. – 700 B.C.E.). 
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts
