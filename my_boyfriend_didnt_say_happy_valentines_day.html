        <h2><strong>my boyfriend didnt say happy valentines day valentines day indians</strong></h2>
        <p>Happy Valentine's Day, friend! It's really unfortunate that he didn't at least say the words to you :(. There's nothing wrong with you! It's been a common thread on this sub today that some boyfriends "don't believe in Valentines Day" or "won't celebrate [it]". This could be the case! 
haven't seen my boyfriend since Friday, asked him to message me Sunday and we could figure out when to hang out again. he hasn't said anything since Friday and today is Valentine's day and nothingi know he doesn't like it but I do. a simple "happy Valentine's day" would be nice..I'm feel left out. + I'm always the one initiating conversations/asking to hang out. 
After five dates, on the Saturday before Valentine's Day, we slept together. Valentine's Day comes and goes and he didn't mention it to me, didn't ask me out, or even say "Happy Valentines" day to me. 
Absolutely. Just because you aren't an official couple doesn't mean Valentine's Day doesn't exist to you. If I were you, I'd question whether or not he was interested in furthering the relationship. Guys aren't stupid. If they're in a precarious situation with a girl (ie: dating but not official), they're going to remember stuff like Valentine  
If he's cancelling on you once he's found out it's Valentine's Day, he doesn't sound like much of a stand up guy. This is exactly what I don't get. I'm a guy that doesn't really "do" Valentine's Day, either, but I sure as hell wouldn't let it stop me from going out on a date that I already arranged. 
I’d say you could start telling him happy valentine’s first. Some people may think you don’t care about certain holidays anymore. I’m probably going to try and do smth special for my boyfriend though it may be difficult since we are currently long distance. 
Yesterday I was waiting for my boyfriend to wish me a happy Valentine’s Day but when it came around 6 o’clock and he still didn’t say anything about it I brought up how it hurt my feeling because I felt like he forgot it was valentines and he knew we already couldn’t see each other because of work and travel distance. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
It wasn't wrapped or anything. It was a watch I wanted. And said this is a valentine/anniversary present. He didn't have to do anything major yesterday. Maybe a card or even a Happy Valentines Day message. He says he doesn't believe in it. I ended up going out with my friends during the day before they had plans for evening with their partners. 
All day we see signs in stores, talking about love, posts online, text from friends, chocolate filled hearts aplenty. It ‘ s everywhere and, when your boyfriend forgets Valentine ‘ s Day, the day is horrible. That being said, don ‘ t forget that the day after Valentine ‘ s Day is just another day. Another day when life goes on. 
My Boyfriend Didn’t Do Anything For Valentines Day. Since it is a boyfriend in this case, it is clear that the relationship has yet to reach a more serious stage, such as an engagement or marriage. But that doesn’t mean the relationship isn’t serious. If anyone needs to impress you on Valentine’s Day, it’s your boyfriend. 
I really like Valentine’s Day and I want to be able to celebrate it but my boyfriend does not. He thinks it’s dumb and someone’s love for someone shouldn’t be summed up into one day. This always leads into fights with us mainly because he won’t compromise to at least say happy Valentine’s Day to each other. 
Happy Valentine’s Day to my darling. Let’s have our adventure on this Valentine day. Roses are red, fitness is great, I would have gotten you chocolate, but you need to continue your diet. Happy Valentine’s Day my dear boyfriend. Valentine Card Messages for Boyfriend. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love! Thank you for making my life so  
All day we see signs in stores, talking about love, posts online, text from friends, chocolate filled hearts aplenty. It ‘ s everywhere and, when your boyfriend forgets Valentine ‘ s Day, the day is horrible. That being said, don ‘ t forget that the day after Valentine ‘ s Day is just another day. Another day when life goes on. 
At first he was unsure but then wanted to do it. I knew it wouldn’t arrive in time for Valentine’s day but I was glad he was on board with the idea. I thought he knew it was important to me. So when he didn’t wish me happy Valentine’s Day I was a bit peeved off but instead of getting angry, I let him know that I wish he did. 
Hi! I am also in a long distance relationship and also frustrated with the lack of acknowledgment my boyfriend gave. I too am not super into Valentine’s Day and was not expecting a gift or anything, but fully expected him to say “Happy Valentine’s Day” which he didn’t. You are not alone at all and I understand how you feel. 
It's not even the Feast of Saint Valentine anymore, it's just a pointless day made to sell stuff now and make women feel inferior if their guys didn't buy them enough stuff or such. Relax. Realize how ridiculous Valentine's day actually is, and appreciate the man for whatever virtues you already found appealing. 
Obviously I can’t give his side on my birthday situation, but he didn’t get me anything until the day of, and then didn’t plan a place to eat after just said “I don’t know we could go to eat at X place”. I told him later that I wanted to be thought of more, like more thought into the gift or the dinner/activity. 
"Thank you for always making me feel loved. Happy Valentine's Day, my forever love!" "You're the love story I'll cherish forever. Happy Valentine's Day, my beloved!" "You make my world a better place, and I am beyond grateful for you. Happy Valentine's Day, my love!" "My heart belongs to you, now and always. Happy Valentine's Day, my dear husband!" 
After five dates, on the Saturday before Valentine's Day, we slept together. Valentine's Day comes and goes and he didn't mention it to me, didn't ask me out, or even say "Happy Valentines" day to me. </p>
