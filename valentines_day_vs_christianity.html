        <h2><strong>valentines day vs christianity download valentines day cards printables</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine’s Day started with a connection to Christianity but there is a lot of information to wade through to find the truth. The details within the stories connecting it to Christianity are difficult to prove. Nevertheless, Valentine’s Day is connected to Christianity, but not solely. 
Christians can celebrate Valentine’s Day if they want to. There is nothing wrong with sending a friend or your significant other a card and a box of candy on February 14th. One of the only reasons some Christians don’t celebrate it is because of the pagan festival of Lupercalia. 
Most of us enjoy "spoiling" a loved one on Valentine’s Day. Sending gifts and cards conveys love, affection, and friendship. There is no biblical reason why Christians should not celebrate Valentine’s Day by giving their loved ones flowers, candy and/or cards. 
Ancient sources reveal that there were several St. Valentines who died on Feb. 14. Two of them were executed during the reign of Roman Emperor Claudius Gothicus in 269-270 A.D., at a time when persecution of Christians was common. How do we know this? 
All we know is that “Volantynys day” abruptly shows up in a romantic poem by Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th Century and it’s been with us ever since. So what should Christians make of today’s Valentine’s Day? As much as purely possible! Valentine was a saint and Eros is not Cupid’s domain. It’s God’s! 
Valentine's Day has a long and complex history tied to Christianity, but it needs to be clarified how this connection was formed. There are many stories and myths surrounding the origins of Valentine's Day, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction. 
In reality, there are Christians who celebrate Valentine’s Day with enthusiasm, and others that don’t, because of how commercialized it has become. In order to understand better if Christians should celebrate it or not, we should first understand its origins. 
Is Valentine’s Day Christian and should we recognize and celebrate it as part of the Christian church? Much ink has been spilled regarding whether Valentine’s Day should be considered a Christian holiday, and the answer may not be so straightforward. 
On February 14 millions of people exchange tokens and messages of love and affection. Where and how did the curious customs of Valentine's Day begin? Does God have anything to say about such practices? 
Valentine's Day is a holiday celebrated on February 14th, honoring the Christian martyr Saint Valentine. While it is commonly associated with romantic love, the day has a rich history and religious significance in the Christian faith. 
Bible Verses About Valentine’S Day The Nature of Love. As we embrace Valentine’s Day, we get a beautiful reminder of the importance of love in our lives. This love isn’t just about romance; it extends to all kinds of relationships we cherish. The Bible teaches that love is patient and kind, emphasizing how we should treat one another daily. 
No matter what your opinion of this holiday, or if you are going into February with or without a Valentine, this holiday is hard to ignore. And so are all the Valentine’s quotes and sayings that fill the Valentine’s season. There are good Valentine’s Day quotes and mushy, roll-your-eyes quotes too. But, as Christians, what if we turned our eyes to some quotes about love from pastors and  
Do a Valentine’s Day Bible Reading Challenge: Read passages about God’s love (e.g., Romans 5:8, Ephesians 5:25-33) and discuss how to apply them. Plan a Day of “Random Acts of Kindness”: Commit to doing small acts of love for each other or those around you. This Valentine’s Day, let’s not just celebrate love but live it. 
There are alternatives to Anti-Valentine's Day and Valentine's Day beyond just counting it as another day of t he week. Many women have taken to the idea of celebrating gal-pals with Galentine's Day. Galentine's Day is typically celebrated on February 13th, when the gift of friendship is the focal point, not romantic love. It has become a  
Valentine's Day doesn't have to strictly be a day you spend with others. It can be a day to just spend alone and enjoy your own company. 3. Temptation. A third reason why Christians may doubt if they can enjoy Valentine's Day is the matter of temptation. For unmarried couples, Valentine's Day can pose a great temptation to their sexual purity. 
Bible Verses for Valentine's Day: Best Scriptures about Love. Valentine's Day, also known as Saint Valentine's Day, originated as a church holiday on February 14th to honor martyrs of the faith - saints whose names were Valentine or Valentinus. It is believed that the first Heart Valentine note was sent by a Valentine who was in prison for a  
Every year, many people are eager for Valentines’ Day to come for different reasons. For some, this means eating out with their family on a special evening. While for others, this means receiving chocolates and roses from their partners and friends. Although we all celebrate Valentines’ Day differently, we all get it from the same source  
Christian Themes Reflected in Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day is not just about romantic gestures; it also aligns with Christian teachings of love and selflessness. Love thy neighbor: The holiday encourages acts of kindness and generosity, reflecting Jesus’ command to “love one another” (John 13:34). 
Christianity Takes Over Valentine's Day In 469, Pope Gelasius declared February 14th a holy day in honor of Valentinus, instead of the pagan god Lupercus. He also adapted some of the pagan celebrations of love to reflect Christian beliefs. 
Happy Valentine’s Day! Valentine’s Day may not seem like a Christian holiday at first with its emphasis on romance, but what sums up Christianity more than love?
