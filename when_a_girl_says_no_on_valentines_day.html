        <h2><strong>when a girl says no on valentines day a city that helped to ignite valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>An entire day dedicated to declaring your love for someone? If you’re casually hooking up or in a new relationship, Valentine’s Day can be awkward. The reality is you may not be ready to write each other mushy cards, spend money on an expensive dinner, or say “I love you,” if you’re not at a full blown BF/GF status. 
Valentine’s Day can be a time when romantic interests are expressed and reciprocated. While it’s exciting to receive a Valentine’s Day proposal, sometimes it may not align with your feelings or personal circumstances. It’s important to know that saying ‘no’ is perfectly acceptable and can be done with grace and respect. 
Valentine’s Day is a day of love and affection, but sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where someone asks you to be their valentine, and you need to decline their offer. While it can be difficult to turn someone down, it’s important to be honest and kind in your response.

Will you be my valentine, yes or no? Valentine’s day is just around the corner, and what better way to let your love know you care than with a heartfelt ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to the all-important question: Will you be my valentine? If you’re still undecided, here are seven reasons why you should say ‘yes’: 
Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything.
