60 Valentine’s Day Gifts Your Boyfriend Will Actually Want to Receive. Because he likes nice things, too. By Elly Leavitt Published: Jan 29, 2024 6:57 PM EST. Save Article. Edward Berthelot. 
Treat yourself.You and your boyfriend should treat yourself this Valentine’s Day by creating memorable experiences. Whether this means going out for a fancy dinner or enjoying a couple’s spa day together, try doing something that your frugal side would never usually permit. 
You can buy fossils on ebay. One year for valentine's day when things were starting to get serious with my now husband I spent $20 on a tiny fish fossil. Its like 5 million years old or something like that. I got it mostly to symbolize that there are some things in this world that last forever. He thought it was the neatest thing. 
V-Day is just around the corner, and there’s no time like the present to pick out the perfect Valentine’s Day gift. But wait a minute. Should you get your boyfriend a Valentine’s Day gift, or is that holiday only reserved for you to get a gift? In short, the choice truly is up to you. 
You should definitely get him something for Valentines day. In fact, he may even feel embarrassed or confused as to why he got you something but you didn't think you had to. 
Normally I’m great at picking out gifts but I’m feeling stumped right now. I have a customer tshirt that I ordered for him but it won’t arrive until after Valentine’s Day. I kind of want to get him some nice clothes too, like something to wear for our V-day dinner date that could also work for a wedding we plan to attend in March. 
Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and let's be honest-buying the perfect gift for your boyfriend can be a bit of a challenge. You want something thoughtful, useful, and maybe a little unexpected. Whether he's a tech junkie, a fitness fanatic, a guy who just appreciates a good meal or anything in between, we've 
In my opinion, Valentine’s Day shouldn’t be about spending money on actually gift gifts but as a way to show your love for each other. That being said, if you’d prefer spending some money on an actual gift, I would do something like a couples massage or a boudoir photo shoot or something like that. 
While it’s contrary to popular belief, YOU MOST DEFINITELY SHOULD! Valentine’s Day is about celebration of love between the BOTH of you. I used to think only guys had to impress and treat the girls, and I felt shocked and embarrassed when my husband was sad that I wasn’t willing and didn’t even think of giving to him for Valentine’s Day. 
12. Create a playlist. Making a playlist of songs that remind you of your significant other is a sweet way to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Use an app like Spotify, which you probably already have on your phone, and add meaningful songs to your relationship. 
I always get my husband things for Valentine’s Day, anniversaries, etc but ALL of my coworkers were of the opinion that Valentine’s Day is for the women. One of my coworkers was even surprised when her bf texted her asking when they would exchange gifts and had to run out and buy him something. </p>
