        <p>Yes, all the date night vibes on Feb. 14th lead to a mini baby boom after Valentine’s Day. I’m just going to lay it out there: My son was born on Nov. 12. My daughter was due on Nov. 11 (but decided to come early). My own birthday is Nov. 14—exactly nine months after Valentine’s Day. Clearly people in my family are more into the holiday  
From his quick calculations, Wilson estimated that approximately 10,408 babies will be born in November after being conceived on Valentine’s Day. photo: Nicollazzi Xiong via Pexels And while that number of November babies is certainly nothing to scoff at, it doesn’t take home the prize for the most popular birth month. 
According to the CDC and Social Security Administrations estimated that 10,408 babies are born in November after being conceived on Valentine’s Day . This number seems surprising, in fact September actually wins first place in most babies born, averaging upwards 11,000 babies on a annual basis. 
Compared to the weekly average of 15,427 conceptions, we’re talking about a 6 percent increase in babies. That’s pretty significant. In fact, the number is only secondary to the period around Christmas. Thanks to this boost in conceptions, the UK experiences a “mini baby boom” nine months after Valentine’s Day.

An analysis of data from 2015 found that, in an average week in England, 15,427 babies are conceived. But in the week around Valentine’s Day, this figure rose by 5 per cent, to 16,263. 
By my back-of-the-envelope calculations, I can report that 10,408 children will be conceived this Valentine’s Day. Here’s how I arrived at that number. Here’s how I arrived at that number.
