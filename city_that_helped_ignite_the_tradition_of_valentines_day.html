The Evolution of Valentine’s Day Traditions. As Valentine’s Day evolved over the centuries, various customs and traditions emerged. In England, it became customary for people to exchange valentines, small tokens of affection, and love letters. These handwritten notes often featured romantic verses, declarations of love, and artistic  
Pope declared Feb. 14 as Valentine's Day in 5th Century Pope Gelasius declared Feb. 14 as St. Valentine’s Day in 496 AD. It was not until much later, however, that the day became definitively  
The remaining history of Valentine’s Day is only loosely linked to Rome through the Catholic Church, which soon encompassed nearly all of Europe. Valentine’s Day as a Romantic Holiday. According to the legend, in 496, Pope Gelasius I needed a holiday to replace Lupercalia. He settled on Saint Valentine and declared a feast day on February 14th. 
Fancy Valentines were made with real lace and ribbons, with paper lace introduced in the mid-19th century. In 1868, the British chocolate company Cadbury created Fancy Boxes – a decorated box of chocolates – in the shape of a heart for Valentine’s Day. That has become the norm in the present day. 
Chocolate gifting became a Valentine’s Day staple thanks to Richard Cadbury’s invention of the heart-shaped chocolate box in the 1800s. Today, chocolates are one of the top gifts exchanged on Valentine’s Day, with everything from fancy truffles to giant chocolate bars making their way into hearts and hands. 
People were complaining in women’s magazines in the late 19th century that Valentine’s Day was too commercial. “Everybody’s always expecting Valentine’s Day to die out, and it never does,” she said. “It’s sort of like saying, ‘Coney Island’s too crowded. Nobody goes there anymore.’”

This pagan celebration, observed from February 13 to 15, involved the sacrifice of a goat and a dog, followed by a ritual in which young men, clad in the sacrificed animals  
Written valentines began appearing in 1400, and Shakespeare referenced Valentine's Day three times in his plays in the early 1600s. In the 1800s, Esther Howland began mass-producing Valentine's  
Why do we celebrate Valentine's Day today? Valentine's Day's transformation into a holiday about romantic love can be attributed to the Romantic English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. The Times notes that Jack B. Oruch, a late University of Kansas English professor, credits Chaucer for modern ideas about Valentine's Day. Through his research, Oruch  
Valentine’s Day and Italian Romance. Valentine’s Day, with its deep Italian origins, is a celebration of love in its most authentic form. From ancient Rome to modern Italy, the holiday reminds us of love’s power to connect, inspire, and endure. This February 14, honor the Italian spirit of amore with a gift that speaks to the heart.

At the end of the day, Valentine's Day stands as a far gentler event than the ancient Lupercalia. We see it through the lens of heart emojis and carefully curated dates. But the essence remains. We seek love, belonging, and renewal. We come together in big or small ways to affirm that life carries hope. 
But not everyone has the same Valentine’s Day traditions—some countries even celebrate love on a date other than February 14.
