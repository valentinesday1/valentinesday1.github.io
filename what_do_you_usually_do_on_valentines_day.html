        <p>Roses are red, violets are blue, and finding fun things to do on Valentine's Day is no small to-do. In other (less poetic) words, February 14 can be a lot—a lot of hype, a lot of hoopla, and a  
As if buying Valentine's Day gifts wasn't enough, you also have to come up with a creative and fun activity for you and your sweetheart. If you're overwhelmed by the tasks at hand, check out our list of things to do on Valentine's Day to make your February 14 feel extra special this year! 
My favorite date-night ideas usually involve some sort of fun activity, and Valentine’s Day is no exception. There’s so much you can do beyond pulling out a dusty board game from the basement. 
If you're single and you don't want to be, Valentine's Day can be a tough day. But you can find ways to turn the holiday around. Perhaps you'll want to watch an anti-Valentine's Day movie or find a way to celebrate your bad relationships—like a bold woman who went on a doughnut shop crawl with a few friends to mark all of her bad relationships. 
As a couple, you probably have a bucket list, a list of all of the things you want to do, the places you want to visit, and the experiences you want to share "one day." So, for Valentine's Day  
Make your Valentine's date the most memorable one yet with a unique Valentine's Day plan for you and your sweetheart. Get a little creative for fun, romance, and special moments with this list of fun things to do on Valentine's Day. Choose a few of your favorites for a date that hits all the marks for a beautiful day of love and intimacy. 
How do you celebrate Valentine’s Day in a unique way? To celebrate Valentine’s Day uniquely, consider activities outside the traditional dinner date. Try an escape room, take a hot air balloon ride, volunteer together for a cause you both care about, or plan a themed at-home celebration with special decorations and foods. 
A Valentine’s Day outfit, complete with fun accessories like a headband, shoelaces or play jewelry. Or if they’re especially little, a snuggly onesie. Elementary. This is the age of Valentine’s Day parties, decorating Valentine’s Day boxes and sharing treats with friends. Enjoy the festivities together with these ideas. 
Come Valentine’s Day, a scrumptious chocolate cake or a beautifully arranged flower bouquet is never a bad idea, but what about the gift of quality time? If there ever was a day to break from your busy schedules and spend a few hours as just you two, February 14 is it. 
No matter how you spend the day, we’re here to help make your Valentine’s Day extra special with these fun date ideas. 1 Challenge Yourselves to an Escape Room. Willie B. Thomas // Getty Images. 
What do you mean if guys actually care about valentines day? Valentines day is to celebrate love, but only guys are buying flowers, chocolate, planning something nice and romantic and not getting anything. Valentines day should be renamed into “girlfriend day” Doesn’t mean you have to get him flowers or chocolate, but something symbolic. 
Associating Valentine’s Day with romantic love only began in the Middle Ages. This may have been due to Geoffrey Chaucer, who in his 1382 poem “Parlement of Foules”, linked Saint Valentine’s Day to birds choosing their mates: “For this was on Saint Valentine’s Day / When every bird cometh there to choose his mate.” 
Service will be better, prices will be cheaper and you won't get stuck with a stupid "Valentine's Day Menu" designed to maximize profits while zooming you through dinner so they can turn the table. To answer the question - a "good" gift is thoughtful and personalized. 
I am a 25-year-old woman and I love men and I love Valentine’s Day. Here is my advice for you. Get 1 thing that is a traditional romantic gift, and get 1 thing that says something about your girlfriend’s personality. Or, even better, combine the two. For example, if she loves whales, you could get her candy that’s shaped like whales. 
Wasn't expecting him to do anything either, but he showed up with wine and chocolate and told me how much he appreciated me and spending time with me. I was floored and while Valentine's Day has never been a big deal to me, it felt really neat to have someone care enough to do that. 
Do something cute and awesome for yourself!! One of my favourite solo things to do is read a book at a restaurant or coffee shop. Do a cute cozy set up for yourself at home. Decorate a corner. Valentine’s Day is fun solo or with someone. Make little candy bags with kid valentines cards for people you’re close to. It’s always well received. 
If you and your significant other both have busy schedules on Valentine’s Day, this is a great way for the two of you to relax, chat, and share some laughs. To make the simple movie-night more romantic, purchase some Valentine’s Day sweets, like decorated chocolates or chocolate covered strawberries . 
1. Flowers 2. Chocolate / Candy 3. Jewelry 4. A handwritten letter 5. A dinner made or chosen just for her 6. A movie marathon night 7. A spa day 8. A playlist 9. A picture or collage of you two 10. 
I've been single on V day, I've been dating on V day. The simple truth is; when I was in gradeschool— I got at least half as much candy on Valentine's day as I would on Halloween. Then you grow up and there's no more candy. Valentine's will never be as good as it was when I got free candy; so I don't really care one way or the other anymore. 
Write it on a card or find an opportunity to tell them in person, even if it’s over the phone or via Zoom or Facetime. The actual Valentine’s Day gifts are fun, but they’re secondary to the relationship-building opportunities you can create. What creative ideas do you have for expressing love to your grandkids on Valentine’s Day? </p>
