        <h2><strong>is it weird to give your teacher valentines day open when cards for valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>At your age, to be giving a teacher a valentine's card will likely end up embarrassing him and will really weird him out. Don't do it. He's your teacher, and he's a professional. 
I expect to receive absolutely nothing for Valentine's day, and I'm totally okay with that (as are all teachers I know). However, if a student brought be a homemade card, it would definitely make me smile. 
I don't view Valentine's day as a romantic holiday. Moreso a day where you express your gratitude and love to others like friends, family, and those who you look up to. You can view it that way all you want, but understand that is a very unusual take on it - as evidenced by your expressed concerns. 
Why — or why not — do your children give their preschool teachers gifts for Valentine's Day? Cafe Kierna is actually pondering this issue of Valentine's Day gifts for Big Kid teachers, and what age you actually STOP sending in presents, too, so stop on by  
It seems sweet but to be honest that probably would put your professors in a very awkward position because of how valentines gifts are associated with romance so they probably wouldn’t want to accept them from a student due to the connotations that puts on them. 
Most teachers and etiquette experts we spoke with indicated that it is usually recommended to give every student in the classroom a valentine, especially if your child is passing them out at 
Many schools have written policies specific to Valentine’s Day, especially in the lower grades. Typically, it’s a give-one-give-all rule to keep the big day from morphing into one big popularity contest. DO let your child get creative. If he wants to make homemade cards, why support the greeting card industry instead? If the school allows  
Is it weird to give your teacher a gift? It’s not weird to give teachers gifts but you should wait until the school term is over and grades are registered. That way there wouldn’t be any bias when grading papers. 
These Valentine's Day gifts for teachers celebrate all the love they give to your child. Make their hearts swell with these cute teacher gift ideas. 
While teachers always appreciate a card with a heartfelt message, they certainly don’t expect gifts on Valentine’s Day. Still, some of us wouldn’t want to let the holiday pass by without giving our favorite educators something extra special. 
Valentine's day was an invention of the greeting card and floral industry to sell more cards and flowers (as was Mother's Day). Ladt time I gave cards to all my friends was in third grade. You're 18. Grow up and do adult things. No one will think you're weird. 
Photo by 3wonderfullboys. I wasn't sure whether Valentine's Day was a "gift" holiday, where I need to pick up something for my children's teachers. Last night, as I was helping my daughter spell her preschool teacher's name on one of her cards, I figured that gesture alone was probably enough. 
We are donating a snack to the class Valentine’s party and my 3 year old picked cards to give her classmates. We typically donate snacks for holiday parties, bring in treats on her birthday for both the kids and staff, and give the teachers gifts at Christmas.

This Valentine’s Day, spoil the educators in your life with a special present. Here are the best Valentine’s Day gifts for teachers that will put a smile on their face. 
Clearly people have all adopted different traditions and I don’t think it’s actively weird to give people other than your SO things in Valentine’s Day. But the entitlement of being the one who decides the present and future traditions for her son is the weird thing. 
It will look a little odd if you give a box to all of your friends and then give him one, but if you do it casually, it should be no different than opening a box of gum and feeling obligated to give twenty seven million members of your class a piece. However, don't expect him to take it as the revelation of your crush on him. 
I find your comment really weird. You 100% assumed why OP's father gave his daughter valentine's day flowers then you say OP giving his sister valentine's day flowers is patronizing (how..) and unnecessary when it's actually very sweet and I bet she'd appreciate it. 
This heartfelt teacher keychain works for Valentine’s Day whether the teacher is a male or female. It’s got charms that stand out from other keychains which honor the art of teaching. There’s a flower, a red apple, an owl with multicolored stones, and a charm. The charm says, “Thank you for helping me grow and learn.” 
Thank you for being an extraordinary teacher! Wishing a Happy Valentine’s Day to a teacher who goes above and beyond to make learning a delightful journey. Your passion for education is truly heartwarming. Happy Valentine’s Day to the teacher who not only imparts knowledge but also spreads love and positivity. </p>
