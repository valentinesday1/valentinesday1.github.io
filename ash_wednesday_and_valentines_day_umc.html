        <p>Personally, I think celebrating Ash Wednesday and Valentine’s Day on the same day is a great way to not only affirm God’s great “I Love You!” in Jesus’ life, teaching, death, and resurrection, but to respond to Christ’s call to live lives full of the compassion that he taught us. 
For churches celebrating St. Valentines Day as a feast day, this battle was decided centuries ago: They called it for Ash Wednesday. Culture, on the other hand, probably remains open to debate. I mean, when the clash of the two only occurs three times in a centurydoes Ash Wednesday get an automatic win because it comes out of nowhere to  
If Valentine belongs in [an Ash Wednesday observance], it is precisely as a martyr.” In a Facebook conversation, several United Methodist clergy from around the United States discussed how they would focus on Ash Wednesday while acknowledging Valentine’s Day. “To ignore the secular would seem out of touch; besides, why not redeem it? 
Our online Ash Wednesday service will broadcast at 6:30 a.m., noon, and 6:30 p.m., on our Facebook page or website. We will provide the imposition of ashes in person following each of those services, 7 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 7 p.m., at both The Portico location and the Magnolia parking lot of our Hyde Park location. 
Purple is the most traditional color throughout Lent; but on Ash Wednesday gray, with its suggestion of ashes, is especially appropriate. Dark earth colors or any somber hues are also appropriate. Rough, coarse textures such as burlap—sackcloth and ashes—suggest the character of the day and season. 
In other words, we need to be clear about why we come to worship on this day. It’s not about showing one another how righteous we are. Our piety is about properly ordering ourselves before God and then neighbor. On Ash Wednesday, especially, we gather to confess and repent to realign ourselves with the truth that God is God, and we are not. 
“THE MOST IMPORTANT THING” 1 Corinthians 13 Welcome to one of two services in the Christian year that are specifically designed to make you feel bad. The ashes, the prayers, the psalm of confession  these are not exactly pleasant. But feeling bad is not all bad if it gets us headed in the right 
An Oregon clergy couple celebrated Valentine’s Day early on a recent road trip because they knew they’d be busy at a United Methodist church’s Ash Wednesday service on Feb. 14.

Ash Wednesday begins the season of Lent, a time when many Christians prepare for Easter by observing a period of fasting, repentance, moderation and spiritual discipline. Although Ash Wednesday has ancient roots, it does not appear in the rituals of The United Methodist Church or our predecessor denominations until the 20th century. 
Vermont United Methodist Church- Kingsport, Tennessee We will have our regular Pastor’s BYOB (Bring Your Own BIBLE) at 10:00 am and then Ash Wednesday Service for everyone at 6:30 pm and round it out with Cantata practice at 7:15 pm.

“But two, far from being the necessary number for Friendship, is not even the best.” (p. 61). The love of Ash Wednesday is this love of friendship – with Christ, first of all, and, through Christ, with one another. Although many dinner dates will have to be rescheduled this year, Ash Wednesday doesn’t threaten Valentine’s Day. 
Today is Ash Wednesday. Many people place ashes on their forehead or sometimes the hand, in the shape of a cross, to show an outward sign of how they feel inside. Ash Wednesday is the beginning of Lent. Lent is the forty days, not counting Sundays, before Easter.

On Wednesday, February 14th, we celebrate Valentine’s Day and begin our Lenten pilgrimage.

Join us for worship in the Sanctuary or online at 9am &amp; 11am in person or on Facebook Live &amp; YouTube (Baylake 
In Western Christianity, Ash Wednesday marks the first day, or the start of the season of Lent, which begins 40 days prior to Easter (Sundays are not included in the count). 
In the Christian tradition, Ash Wednesday also marked the beginning of preparation for the understanding of the death and resurrection of Christ. The particular symbolism of ashes for this day comes from a practice in the Roman Catholic churches in which the ashes from the palms used in the preceding year's Palm Sunday celebration are blessed.
