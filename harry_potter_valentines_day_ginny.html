        <p>This message was spoken by Ginevra Weasley to a dwarf during a Valentine's Day celebration in order to let him give the message to Harry Potter. Harry however was not fond of this and tried to run away from the dwarf, until he tripped and fell in a hallway and the dwarf began to sing, which led all students in the hall laugh. Draco Malfoy seemed to know the poem was from Ginny, and made a

Yes, Rowling confirmed this in a 2005 interview with the fansites The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet; she went a bit farther and confirmed that Ginny did it of her own accord, not under the influence of Riddle's Diary: M[elissa] A[nelli]: Did Ginny send Harry the valentine? JKR: Yeah, bless her. MA: Was it a Tom Riddle thing, or Ginny Weasley? 
Valentine's Day or Saint Valentine's Day was an annual event celebrated on 14 February in both the Non-magic and the wizarding worlds. It was the traditional day on which people expressed their love for each other, particularly romantic love, by sending Valentine's cards, presenting flowers, or offering sweets. During his years as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  
‘Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!’ drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. On Valentine’s Day. When Ginny (anonymously) sent Harry a Valentine’s Day message. ‘His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, 
Plus, she didn’t have the Diary on Valentines Day. So inaccurate timeline. “M[elissa] A[nelli]: Did Ginny send Harry the valentine? JKR: Yeah, bless her. MA: Was it a Tom Riddle thing, or Ginny Weasley? JKR: No, Ginny Weasley.” Buuut, let’s forget that. We KNOW Ginny had a big huge massive crush on her Golden-Knight-Hero-Boy-Who-Lived  
Apparently it was confirmed elsewhere that Ginny indeed wrote it, which was really confusing to me, because I don’t recall it ever being explained that the dwarves Lockhart hired for Valentine’s Day were an open service meant for the students to utilize. I just thought all the Valentines were penned by him. LOL. 
Do you like Harry Potter and reading about snogging? Then this is the post for you! Here I have compiled some of the best valentine, romance, and snogging based moments from the books. All quotes from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, obv. Let me know your fave Harry P snogging scenes! Happy Valentine's Day! Snogging! 
The nature of her weird obsession with him was seen in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when, for Valentine’s day, Ginny sent him an anonymous message where Harry was serenaded by a number of dwarves whose lyrics comprised of stuff like “His hair is as dark as a blackboard. 
'You just kissed Potter. Potter. On Valentine's Day. Potter. And you enjoyed it.' "Shut up, Potter." He snarled instead. "It was in the heat of the moment, and it will never happen again, and if you ever tell anyone what happened here, I'll hex you until you can't even move." "Ha!" Harry yelled. "As if I would tell anyone about that disgusting  
Ginny smiled as she thought of Valentine's Day past. For her and Harry's first Valentines, Harry owl ordered a silver heart-shaped locket. He had her initials engraved on the back and Hermione had taken her favorite picture of Harry and had made a copy and then shrunk it to fit in the locket. A permanent sticking charm kept the picture in place.

The Valentine's Day Gift. Ginny Weasley had a dilemma, and very little time to sort out what to do. The Love of her Life,(though he wasn't aware of that fact as of yet), one Harry James Potter was completely miserable and Ginny was determined to do something about it. 
Gilderoy Lockhart dispatched a dozen “surly” dwarfs reciting poems for Valentine’s Day in Harry’s Second Year . One of the dwarfs tracked down Harry and tackled him at the knees, then sang a Valentine poem right in front of Draco Malfoy ( CS13 ). 
A Valentine's Day celebration was held by Gilderoy Lockhart for students and staff of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1993. He hoped it would be a "morale booster" for the school due to the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.[1] During the 1992–1993 school year, the Chamber of Secrets was reopened, causing considerable stress and tension for students and staff. Gilderoy Lockhart  
The next day was fairly uneventful. Harry and Ginny picked Teddy up early the text morning. They went out shopping so Teddy could get some candy for Valentine's Day. Ginny always loved seeing Harry with Teddy because Harry tried so hard to be a good father figure for the little guy. 
Harry lay sprawled on his bunk, tip of his wand illuminating the Marauder's Map. Ron assumed that Harry was watching Ginny. It looked as though Harry tried to hide this when Ron was around, as though Ron could really care less. Ginny had been devastated when Harry broke things off, but Ron knew that Harry was every inch as gutted.

For Valentine's Day, Ginny decided to take advantage of Lockhart's Valentine-delivering service and wrote Harry a poem detailing everything she liked about him – from his dark hair and green eyes to his heroism as the one who defeated Voldemort. </p>
