        <p>Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the ancient Romans had bloodier, drunker and more naked notions to mark the occasion.

The Truth About Valentine’s Day. You are looking at the skull of an ancient Roman Martyr named Valentine which resides in the Roman church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. Whether or not it’s the skull of the martyr who inspired Valentine’s Day is a matter of some debate, to put it mildly.

Bible Verses About Valentine’S Day The Nature of Love. As we embrace Valentine’s Day, we get a beautiful reminder of the importance of love in our lives. This love isn’t just about romance; it extends to all kinds of relationships we cherish. The Bible teaches that love is patient and kind, emphasizing how we should treat one another daily. 
Valentine’s Day, in fact, originated as a liturgical feast to celebrate the decapitation of a third-century Christian martyr, or perhaps two. So, how did we get from beheading to betrothing on Valentine’s Day? Early origins of St. Valentine. Ancient sources reveal that there were several St. Valentines who died on Feb. 14.

This poem depicts a meeting of birds on Valentine’s Day to select their mates. 
In our fast-paced modern culture, where love is celebrated with ubiquitous red hearts, Cupid’s arrows, and a billion-dollar industry of flowers and chocolates, it is imperative for us as Christians to pause and critically examine the origins and evolution of this day. </p>
