Giri choco (義理チョコ, lit. "obligation chocolate") is chocolate given by women to men on Valentine's Day in Japan as a customary gift.

On Valentine's Day, Japanese women give men chocolate themselves, but not just any chocolate, special chocolate! "Giri choko" is for colleagues and friends, and "honmei choko" is only for true love. A month later, on March 14, men reciprocate with gifts - white sweets or accessories. Some even give teddy bears or jewelry.
