Remember that your boyfriend’s behavior is a reflection of him, not you. It’s important to separate his actions from your worth and not take his behavior personally. If he’s being a jerk, it’s likely due to his own issues and insecurities. Focus on taking care of yourself and don’t let his behavior bring you down.
