        <h2><strong>my boyfriend didnt get me flowers on valentines day happy valentines day card uncle and aunty</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
He never buys me flowers because I get them for myself every week. But I wake up every morning to fresh coffee, he makes my packed lunch to take to work and would literally die to protect me. Valentine’s Day is a fake hallmark holiday that your guy doesn’t see the big deal in. 
Common Reasons a Boyfriend Might Not Give a Valentine’s Gift He May Not Subscribe to the Idea of Valentine’s Day. Many people despise Valentine’s Day because it is a “Hallmark Holiday.” This refers to holidays that no longer celebrate their original meaning and now only exist to sell holiday cards and gifts. 
There is nothing wrong with you. You certainly deserve gifts. Your boyfriend’s failure to get you cards and flowers is probably all about his own relationship with his emotions; it has very little if anything to do with how he feels about you. The male mind is a funny thing. Men are born with all the tender and vulnerable emotions that women  
It could be hard to confine to 1 reason why your boyfriend didn’t get you any gift for Valentine’s. Generally, some reasons why this embarrassing and heartbreaking event happened include: he’s just too busy, your gift might still be in transit, or worse, he doesn’t love you anymore. 
There are different ways to express love. My friend's boyfriend likes to spend time doing recreational activities with her. My boyfriend likes to cook for me. We don't exchange flowers. We exchange our favorite playlists. Make your own terms. Don't follow stereotypes. Experiment with each other to see what makes you two happier. 
I am a 32-year-old woman who has been waiting for a Valentine’s gift since last week. My partner did not take me out, and neither did he provide any gift. I felt so bad, seeing women around me receiving bouquets of flowers, and applying makeup to go for dinner dates. When I raised the issue, he became defensive and walked out on me. 
“Just confessed to my husband that I actually do care about Valentine’s Day and I’ve been running a pick-me long con for 16 years pretending I was super chill and didn’t care,” she wrote. In a follow-up essay on her blog , the author explained that this conversation wasn’t some big, drawn-out argument, but more of a “mild chuckle  
As an example: If my way to offer and receive affection for my special someone is through sharing quality time with them and they just blow me off on Valentine's Day, I'd probably feel hurt too, unless we'd both discussed it and decided that Valentine's day didn't really hold any significance for us. 
I told my boyfriend to plan something for valentines day No you didn't. You said "You do something nice and romantic on valentines dayI just want some romantic time with you" Nothing about planning something special. I had to check the ages. You're acting like 17 not 27. Grow up. Use words more effectively. He's not a mind-reader. 
I am the more masculine one in the relationship and she does tend to treat me more like a man, where she doesn’t give me much reassurance, no valentine’s day gift, makes me come see her, etc. I know I could just tell her how I feel but I feel like I’ve been explaining a lot of things that make me upset lately and i’m just scared to add on. 
so as we all know, valentine’s day was yesterday. earlier on in the week my boyfriend and i talked about our plans for the special day. i told him that i think valentine’s day is kind of dumb (he agreed) and that he didn’t have to get me anything. we’ve been together for 10 months on the 25th. this was our first valentine’s day together so even though i told him i think it’s a  
Dont be sad my boyfriend didn't even knew it was valentines day until i gave him a rose i knew he would have forgotten it, so i just bought 1 flower to remind him :D Your relationship with him is way more important than you buying each other presents. 
However, I never received any flowers to the point that I bought flower lego to have him build it with me on Valentine's day cause he didn’t gift me anything; then I cried and asked him to buy me something for Valentine. I know it’s his first relationship, and he’s not good at gifting, but I always hope that some magical thing happens. 
Obviously I can’t give his side on my birthday situation, but he didn’t get me anything until the day of, and then didn’t plan a place to eat after just said “I don’t know we could go to eat at X place”. I told him later that I wanted to be thought of more, like more thought into the gift or the dinner/activity. 
Last week, he still bought me a very cute couple gift. He just walked in with flowers for Valentine’s Day 2 hours ago. He blows me away every day. I’m going to take him out to dinner and give him a facial and massage when he comes back, and then end the night with some tv Valentine’s Day episodes from our fave cartoons. 
A Valentine’s Day card with a personal message is the best part of Valentine’s Day for me. I would be disappointed if I didn’t get a card from my Fiancé. It’s not about materialism, it’s about the romance. However, YTA for crying. 
My boyfriend didn't get me anything for valentines day and I have no idea why and its bothering me. I'm a little upset. I mean we went to a nice dinner, but no card, flowers, NOTHING! he acknowledged the fact that it was valentines day, he said to me "happy valentines day". but I just don't get it. </p>
