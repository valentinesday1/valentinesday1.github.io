David Bowie: vocals Earl Slick: guitar Tony Visconti: bass guitar Sterling Campbell: drums ‘Valentine’s Day’ was the fourth single released from The Next Day, David Bowie’s 24th studio album. Bowie wrote the song about a high school massacre, told from the perspective of the perpetrator.

Valentine would be a smallish teenage boy and more importantly one who has resolved to engage in a mass shooting at his school. And when he proceeds to do so, said event is what is actually referred to in the lyrics as “Valentine’s Day”. Supposedly, this intent of the piece is to serve as David Bowie’s version of an anti-gun violence song. 
Valentine's Day Lyrics &amp; Meanings: Valentine told me who's to go / Feelings he treasured most of all / The teachers and the football stars / It's in his tiny face / It's in his scrawny hands / Valentine sold his soul / He's got something to say / It's Valentine's day / The rhythm of the crowd / Benny and Judy down / Valentine sees it all / He's got something to say / It's Valentine's day  
In fact, Bowie’s Valentine’s Day, and its accompanying video, actually contain a sobering message about gun control. It’s believed that the song refers to a 2008 University shooting in Northern Illinois which occurred on Valentine’s Day. The track was recorded by American producer Tony Visconti.
