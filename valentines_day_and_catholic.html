        <h2><strong>valentines day and catholic valentines day chocolate cupcake recipe</strong></h2>
        <p>The first Saint Valentine was a Roman priest who reportedly was martyred on the Flaminian Way during the reign of the Emperor Claudius. The other Saint Valentine was a third-century bishop of Terni who was martyred in Rome but whose relics were sent back to his home see. 
Saint Valentine, officially known as Saint Valentine of Rome, is a third-century Roman saint widely celebrated on February 14 and commonly associated with "courtly love."

Learn about St. Valentine, the patron of love and happy marriages, his martyrdom, and the Catholic roots of Valentine’s Day. 
The popular customs of showing love and affection on St. Valentine’s Day is almost a coincidence with the feast day of the saint: During the Medieval Age, a common belief in England and France was that birds began to pair on Feb.14, “half-way through the second month of the year.”

If this is done well, we will no doubt be blessed with healthy and vibrant relationships. 
As we approach St. Valentine’s Day, a day celebrated across the world for love and affection, it is an opportune moment to reflect on the deeper meaning of love as envisioned by our Catholic Faith. For those called to the vocation of marriage, the path to this sacrament is not just a pursuit of companionship, but a journey toward sanctity. 
Today's Saint Valentine's Day celebrations reflect the essence of Valentine's life. Cards, chocolates, flowers, and various expressions of love carry forward the legacy of this saint. They are tokens that acknowledge our shared duty to love one another, as Christ has loved us.

Although the mid-February holiday celebrating love and lovers remains wildly popular, the confusion over its origins led the Catholic Church, in 1969, to drop Saint Valentine's Day from the Roman calendar of official, worldwide Catholic feasts. 
February 14 is an interesting day for Catholic Christians. We live in the midst of a secular culture that celebrates Valentine’s Day, which supposedly marks the joy of romantic love in our lives. However, the Catholic faith prescribes that we celebrate the Memorial of Sts. Cyril and Methodius, a monk and a bishop whose lives [] 
According to Butlers Lives of the Saints, first published in four volumes in London between 1756–1759, Saint Valentine was martyred by beheading in Rome on February 14 in 269 CE and his feast day, “Saint Valentine’s Day,” was established by Pope Gelasius I in 496. 
His most popular history is his habit of secretly witnessing Catholic marriages, thereby aiding vocations in a highly persecuted era. Eventually, he was martyred for his faith; his feast day is on February 14th! Thus, Valentine’s Day is much more than just an occasion to send pretty cards–or to bemoan your own loneliness. </p>
