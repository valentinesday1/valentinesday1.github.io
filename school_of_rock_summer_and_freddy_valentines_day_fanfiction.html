"It's too bad I don't have feelings for her, she's such a nice girl. Not to mention, she's pretty hot, but she just dresses sort ofpreppy--whoa." Freddy's gaze traveled off to a girl who just walked in. She

Summer chirped happily, even though inside she was dreading going over Freddy's. "Oh and Summer, when are you and Zack going to get together, you would be so cute together." Summer had to smile at this, she had been trying to get the two together ever since the band had come together, and they had started to hang out every day, even now, when

Chapter 1: My Sk8er Boi. NORMAL POV. It was April 18. The day before Summer's 17th birthday. The School of Rock kids were jamming out at the concert they were at.

In this story, Tomika, Zack, Summer, Freddy, and Lawrence are all 17 and in High School. They are all still in the band, which means that Mr. Finn transferred to be a high school teacher. This is my first fan fic so please review. Also, I don't own School of Rock (don't sue!). Enjoy! 
Lawrence sat there reading, Freddy kept talking on and on about Katie-this, Katie-that, my girlfriend-this, my girlfriend-that, etc. Dewey just listened to Freddy talk, thinking it was pure entertainment watching hardcore Freddy getting all mushy over Posh Spice. But Zack just sat there watching Summer. "Whats wrong with me? This is Summer.

"More costumes," Katie hissed. I laughed. Billy had been using Freddy and Katie as his models for School of Rock since 5th grade, even though they hated it. Last time Billy had to make costumes, Katie and Freddy hid in a tree. They climbed up to the highest branches of the old oak in the park that we used to use for "Hide and Seek" when we were  
The next day, I woke up to find Zack's head on mine. I grabbed my phone to find a text from Summer. "Freddy and I r going 2 eat breakfast at IHOP. Wanna come? We're inviting Zack and Lawrence, 2." she texted. "Sure. I'll meet u guys there at 11, ok?" I texted back. "Oh, btw, Zack said he's coming, 2". A few minutes later, Summer texted, "Great! 
And he couldn't wait for that day. He wondered if the others knew this, if they felt the same. They'd all changed a lot since the band had started. Zack was losing the feeling for the band. He wanted to go home, to Summer, and start a family. She disapproved of all this, Freddy knew, and he wanted to hit some sense into her. 
Hello, my fellow readers. It is I, James Stryker bringing you a brand-new story for Best Friends Whenever and Bunk'd and it is a first in a new series of one-shots that are Valentine's Day-themed since Valentine's Day is coming up in thirteen days. So, I figured that I could post a few before Valentine's Day comes or till the end of February.
