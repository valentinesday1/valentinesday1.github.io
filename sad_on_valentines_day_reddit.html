        <h2><strong>sad on valentines day reddit international relations valentines day card</strong></h2>
        <p>Yes. My relationships have never made to Valentine's day. Usually by Valentine's day I would have found out my girl is cheating on me or we would have broken up because of tension and conflict. 
The saddest was when my friend proposed marriage to the girl he loved on Valentine's Day and she flat out turned him down. He was heartbroken - especially since they'd been dating a long time and got along so well. 
Man every year it gets harder and harder, like I work in retail so seeing loving couples around this time of year really makes me sad and depressed. I'm even thinking about calling out from work just to avoid the depression. Any one else ever feel this way on Valentine's day? 
If you’re giving up on love this Valentine’s Day, open up a heart-shaped box of chocolates, pour another glass of wine, and keep reading to find out about these Reddit users who revealed their most depressing Valentine stories. 
“Valentine’s Day Blues” refer to a set of negative emotions including sadness, loneliness or anxiety that some individuals experience in association with Valentine’s Day, a holiday 
While the men in the study tended to rebound in mood after about two weeks, the women’s self-reported symptoms of sadness often lingered over three weeks. Given the stress associated with 
3. "I have an ongoing worst Valentine's Day experience. Every year without fail, whenever I have someone I'm dating or excited about, it inexplicably blows up or ends before Valentine's Day  
If you’re feeling angry, lonely, or sad this Valentine’s Day, invite those feelings in. Notice your feelings, be curious about what they’re trying to tell you, and offer yourself comfort by practicing self-care and self-compassion. 
Feeling sad or feeling lonely on Valentine's Day is totally normal. Here are ways to combat feeling blue on the romantic holiday. 
Valentine's day sucks rocks. All it really is, is a reminder to those of us who don't have anyone what losers we are. It's very discriminatory, patronizing, insulting, and arrogant. 
High School. Purchased a teddy bear and a (very thin) gold necklace for a girl I had just started dating. Gave her the bear, she gushed (over-the-top fake gratitude, but clearly disappointed), but she didn't notice the necklace I put on the bear. 
As someone who will be alone valentine's day, but prior to this was not I will say this. Forget about getting into a relationship for a day. Because if I could give you one piece of advice its that valentine's day feels really sad and lonely when your with the wrong person. So be happy with some friends this quarantine. 
This is the first Valentine's Day in 4 years where I've got someone (they're amazing!) to spend it with. We just met by chance and I am so grateful! She is very supportive and tells me all the time that she's amazed I spent so much time single. 
For mine and my SO's anniversary (which is only a week and a half off from Valentine's Day), I did a 365 note jar. The idea is that the person gets to open up one note every day for the next year with a message of some sort from you, usually things like your favorite memories with them, reasons you love/appreciate them. 
The romantic day where you and your s/o get each other gifts and cuddle and watch movies .does anyone else get upset or mad about that day ? 
Same! I seemingly never have a girlfriend around valentine's day. Valentine's day is really a store created holiday. As a concept valentine's day is really weird. It's a day where you show your partner you love them.. But shouldn't that happen every day regardless. Grand gestures of affection don't need a specific day. 
I’ve been single for over five years and I prefer the single lifestyle, but for some reason I get really sad and lonely on Valentine’s Day. I get over it the next day, and everything goes back to normal. This year, however, I didn’t wake up feeling sad! 
It’s going to take all my power to not message him on Valentine’s day or try to beg for him back so we can spend it togetherbut will he also feel sad when the day comes around? I just feel like the holiday so widely revolves around women (not that I wouldn’t buy him gifts but) that he’s probably relieved he doesn’t have the

Just needed to vent somewhere of how lonely and sad it feels to have your first Valentines day without that someone you thought you'd be with forever and have a family with. I'm so grateful to have a child who keeps me sane and fills my heart despite the struggles on making sure she doesn't see me sad and hurt. </p>
