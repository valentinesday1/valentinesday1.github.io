        <h2><strong>its st valentines day god wants us to have sex ffxiv saint valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Oscar Wilde is reported to have observed, “Everything in the world is about sex, except sex. Sex is about power.” Which is the same as to say that everything in the world is about power. And Mr. Wilde was certainly right in his assertion, though he was right in a way he could not have imagined. 
If God has given His metaphoric thumbs up to sexual relations for purposes other than populating the planet, it is nonetheless true that the Bible is replete with admonitions against sex. 
“For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.” Ephesians2:10 (NLT) On Valentine’s Day, we often celebrate the romantic relationship of love between a man and a woman. For many of us, however, this day doesn’t bring romance; instead, it brings pain. 
Love is unconditional. That’s the kind of love God has for us. And, of course, that’s how Jesus loved his disciples. So when Jesus said: “Love one another, as I have loved you,” he was making an appeal to us to love others like God loves us. Valentine’s Day is a great opportunity to show love to everyone--even to our enemies. 
It is about preparing ourselves to be saints, praying for the spouse God has for us, and living in a way that is worthy of the sacrament of marriage. May this reflection on St. Valentine’s Day inspire us to live love as God intended, and to become the husbands and wives that our future spouses deserve, and the world needs. 
Go to the Bible. Then you will know the real truth behind St. Valentine’s Day. And you will know what God expects you to do about it! Valentine’s Past. Like Christmas, Easter, Halloween, New Year’s and other holidays of this world, St. Valentine’s Day is another attempt to “whitewash” perverted customs and observances of pagan gods  
However, one of my favorite reminders of how the Lord pursues us in our failure comes from Romans 5:8, which states, “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” That doesn’t mean He ignores and condones deliberate disobedience. He won’t bless what leads us to increased bondage. 
And it’s meant to be drunk freely. Awaken Love. Married lovers, have you lost your taste for this wine? If so, go to the Song together. Walk back through the vineyards. Have foxes gotten in and spoiled them (Song 2:15)? It may be that for you this Valentine’s Day is a moment when you resolve together to “awaken love” (Song 3:5). 
Perseverance: Stay committed to love, even when it’s hard or unreciprocated. Conclusion. God’s love is the foundation of all love. When we truly grasp the depth of His love for us, it transforms how we view and treat others. This Valentine’s Day, let’s focus on reflecting His love in our relationships. 
Read God's Valentine by Jan Shrader and more articles, devotionals and current events stories on St. Valentine's Day.  God in love wants us to experience his love and forgiveness; his peace and  
As Christians, this Valentine Day must be a time to re-commit our lives to the Lord: God is love and the source of true love. God loved us enough to die for us and St. Valentine loved God enough to die for God’s Truth. What better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day than to commit or recommit our lives to Christ. 
Love is truth and love speaks truth. Truth is freedom to experience the fullness of God’s love. Titus 1:2 says that God does not lie.. Play a game with your child called True and False. 
But some don’t like Valentine’s Day at all and try to avoid it completely. It’s interesting how different people feel about this holiday. But here’s what I think is most important: No matter how you feel about Valentine’s Day, there’s something we all share. We all have a King who made us and loves us always, no matter what. 
Set the scene “Setting the mood and stimulating all of the senses (sight, sound, smell, touch and taste) enhances the experience,” says sex and relationship coach Uta Demontis.She suggests  
Prayer to St. Valentine. Dear Saint and glorious martyr, Teach us to love unselfishly and to find great joy in giving. Enable all true lovers to bring out the best in each other. Let them love each other in God and in God in each other. Love. Love is patient and kind, It doesn’t envy or boast and it’s never proud. Love is not rude or selfish, 
When the Lord your God cuts off from before you the nations which you go to dispossess, and you displace them and dwell in their land, take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed from before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods? 
i think that it does not really matter what the writer of this or the other people commenting has to say about valentine's day because in the end its up to God if he does not quote unquote like the holy or unholy holliday/celebration. if someone would like to take the risk of him not "liking" it then more power to him because what if he does like it. i can personally see both sides of the  
2. MY POEM. In Ephesians 2:10, God calls us His workmanship and in Greek, that word translated means poetry.We are God’s poem, and he knows us by heart. 3. SOUL MATE. In Matthew 22:37, Jesus  </p>
