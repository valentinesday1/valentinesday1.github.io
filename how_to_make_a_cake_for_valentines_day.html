February 14th is one of the most polarizing days of the year. You either swoon at the idea of an entire day dedicated to love—or the thought of a mischievous cherub with a quiver full of arrows  
This delicious Pink Velvet Cake is based on our popular Vanilla Velvet Cake, but with the addition of pink coloring, making it perfect for Valentine's Day! It is very moist with great vanilla flavor, and richness from the cream cheese in the cake batter. 
Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and so today we are sharing some of our favorite Valentine's Day cakes! We love red velvet cakes, strawberry and cherry cakes for Valentine's Day (all things pink and red!), as well as go-to chocolate cakes, champagne cakes, and more. You'll also find a few fun cake designs in this collection as well! 
Serve this cake alongside a cup of coffee to top off your home-cooked Valentine's Day meal. This slow cooker recipe, starting with a box of cake mix, couldn't be more straightforward. Add a package of dark chocolate morsels between cake layers. 
How To Make This Valentine’s Day Cake Recipe. This cake is so easy to make! The best part? You can mix the chocolate cake batter right in a single bowl; no heavy equipment needed. That means you’ll only need your mixer for the buttercream! STEP 1. Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a large mixing  
Favorite Valentine's Day Designs. Some of our featured Valentine's Day cake designs and cake recipes were created especially for the holiday, and many could be used year-round for all sorts of occasions including anniversaries, baby showers, and more! 
Prepare the Cake . Prepare oven and cake pans: Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease (with butter) and flour 1 (8-inch) round cake pan. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; lightly grease parchment paper with butter. 
Equipment. To make these cake pops for Valentine's day, you'll need some cake pop sticks, as well as a #40 cookie scoop to scoop out even amounts. I used this cake pop making kit because it also includes wrappers, cute little ties, an acrylic cake pop stand, and a cake pop press -- I didn't use the press, but it should help to give you more evenly shaped Valentine's cake balls. 
Valentine’s Day is the perfect occasion to get creative with your baking, and what better way to celebrate love than with a gorgeous Valentine’s Day cake? Whether you want to make something simple yet sweet or go all out with a show-stopping cake design, there are endless possibilities for creating a cake that will delight your loved ones. 
Pin Simple Pink Heart Cake with Cherries. This pink heart cake is a showstopper with its delicate sponge layers and white chocolate ganache. The maraschino cherries and pink hues make it a festive treat for Valentine’s Day. 
Prepare the Frosting. If you’re using a standard 5-quart mixer, it’s much easier to prepare the frosting for the cake first and make a separate, smaller batch of frosting for decorating the cake. 
If you're bringing Valentine’s Day treats for the classroom, this portable cake is perfect as it can be cut into 12 to 20 slices. It's decorated with red, pink and white toppings like sliced strawberries and candy sprinkles but you can choose to decorate it as you wish. 
Melt butter and chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth, then cool slightly. Whisk egg yolks into the chocolate mixture. 
OPEN TO COLLAB!  guys! These Valentine's Day cake pops are super adorable, and I'll share with all my secrets to supe 
Essentially you just need 6 parts cake to one part frosting, (3 cups of cake crumbs for every ½ cup frosting) and everything gets smooshed together to make a rollable, shapable 'cake-pop' mix. Buy cake and ready-made frosting, or just buy a whole frosted cake, scrape the frosting off and then add the appropriate amount back in. 
Step 3. Divide your cake mixture into 20 sections. With the palm of your hand, round out each portion into a ball shape. Step 4. Place your cake pops on a sheet pan lined with wax paper or a piece of parchment paper, and place in the freezer for 15 minutes. 
Eye ball the cake batter to make sure the thickness of it in each pan looks similar. Bake the cakes according to the cake mix recipe. Remove the cakes from their pans. Cut the circle cake in half evenly. Position the square cake so it looks like a diamond, then place each half of the circle cake like this: Place the cake on a large plate or  </p>
