        <h2><strong>sso ride through valentines day how it celebrate along the countries valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day (or Galentine's Day) is an event typically held around the month of February and generally lasts two to three weeks. During this event, players can chase and find lost love letters as well as participate in a friendship race. Note: Valentine's Day will not be returning to the game. Instead, the Equestrian Festival is Spring's new main celebration. This is stated in SSO's news  
The 2017 update added the Valentine's Race, allowing users to collect Friendship hearts to turn in for rewards. The 2018 update made the biggest change, removing Catherine and Donald's quests completely, but leaving the Love Letter quests, the Valentines Race, and the special Valentine's Day shops. 
Happy Valentine's Day from Star Stable! Valentine’s Day Quests: Double the Fun! To celebrate Valentine's Day, we thought we'd show you that we love you with not one but two sets of super fun quests where two of the islanders need lots of help dealing with the fact they've taken on WAY too much work for themselves in the run-up to Valentine's Day 
Make sure to come back every day to get enough hearts to collect all 12 items! Lowe offers one showjumping race at Jorvik Stables Arena, and one wild race through Jarlaheim. Talk to her to get started! If you have collected heart tokens from previous celebrations, you will not be able to use them this time. 
Valentine's Day/Galentine's Day Main Article: Valentine's Day Valentine's Day was celebrated in February. During this time, players could collect and deliver love letters for rewards, do Valentine's Day baking, and gather materials for Valentine's Day gifts. There were also special races which rewarded the event's currency, Friendship Hearts. 
The Valentine’s festivities last until February 28, meaning there’s plenty of time to take part in all the exciting stuff that’s happening in Jorvik! Derek’s lost love letters Mailman Derek is having busy days right now because of all the love letters being sent for Valentine’s, and he could really use your help. Ride over to the post

I'm normally so bitter about this day of the month because of obvious reasons But here we have the SSO valentine's day update! It's just a quick overview  
They stated that religious holidays would be removed from SSO. That’s why Christmas was sort of dulled down and renamed Winter Festival. Easter was removed and Valentines Day which also stems from a Christian celebration of a Saint was removed as well. Pretty much a majority of Christian holidays. 
Hi, I’m a Star Rider and level 7. Today I tried championships for the first time at Fort Pinta. I entered the race by talking to the championship manager and everything was fine but then the race started and i didn’t know. 
You might have been to the Sunfield farm already? If not, it’s quite simple to locate it.

Objectives: Ride to the Sunfield farm and speak to Filip.
