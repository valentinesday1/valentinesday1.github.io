        <p>On February 14, around the year 270 A.D., Valentine, a holy priest in Rome in the days of Emperor Claudius II, is said to have been executed. He helped inspire the holiday of Valentine's Day. 
So, how did we get from beheading to betrothing on Valentine’s Day? Early origins of St. Valentine Ancient sources reveal that there were several St. Valentines who died on Feb. 14. 
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the ancient Romans had bloodier, drunker and more naked notions to mark the occasion. 
St. Valentine -— whether priest or bishop — was martyred on February 14th, now celebrated as Valentine’s Day. According to most accounts, he was beaten and then beheaded, after a time of

But behind the rosy facade of Valentine’s Day is a mysterious—and grisly—tale of a beheading and body parts scattered  He says Valentine’s Day is the only time the relics receive many  
Where did Valentine’s Day originate? For years, the consensus among historians was that the holiday had something to do with an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia that fell in mid-February. Noel Lenski, a Yale University historian, pointed to the seasonal and thematic connections between Lupercalia and modern Valentine’s Day. 
Another way St. Valentine's Day may have come to be celebrated as a day of love was because the bird mating season was thought to begin around mid-February, Lupton noted. St. Valentine's Day as it is known today was also instituted as a substitute for a cruder Roman holiday at the time, called Lupercalia, Lupton added.

Valentine’s Day, long embraced in Sheboygan, hasn’t always been rosy. Here's a look back. Among the not-so-rosy moments in the day's history was the beheading of St. Valentine near Feb. 14  
From beheadings to Pandora, Valentine's Day has changed over the years. Valentine's Day is believed to have started as a replacement for the Roman festival Lupercalia, while others have put

Valentine’s Day is typically a celebration of love and romance. But the holiday’s origins are pretty dark, including stories of beheadings, animal blood, and much more.
