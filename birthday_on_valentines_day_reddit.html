Not much but older brother on the 11th of April with my mothers on the 13th. 13x2=26 (my birthday). 11+13=24th of October my younger brothers birthday. October is the tenth month so 24-10=14th of May my dads birthday. May is the 5th month, 14+5=19th of March (my other younger brother’s birthday

Since my birthday is on Valentine’s Day, I happen to be bombarded with candy from friends and family in the days following my birthday, which is AMAZING!! Photo courtesy of www.reddit.com via Giphy 2. Everyone is celebrating on your birthday. Whether they mean to or not, everyone who celebrates Valentine’s Day is also celebrating your birthday! 
Jake Lacy, Tati Westbrook and Danai Gurira are all fortunate to call Feb. 14 their birthday — and they're not alone. See which other celebrities were brought into the world on Valentine's Day. 
How many people propose on Valentine’s Day each year? Answer: Around 6 million. What holiday sells more greeting cards than Valentine’s Day? Answer: Christmas. What country celebrates “Friendship Day” instead of Valentine’s Day? Answer: Finland. Which fast-food chain once offered Valentine’s Day dinner reservations? Answer: White  
Lastly, DH's birthday is the 16th of February and I always combine his birthday and Valentine's Day gifts anyways. Once you get close enough to the holiday I think it is better just go have your birthday right on that holiday since you will be getting combo gifts anyways. 
The positives and negatives are mere vagary and won’t make a big dent on the day. Valentines day and birthday — both have lost it’s sheen for me over the years but i am sure as a teen or a  
My birthday is on Valentine’s Day too and I’ve never been the type to want anything big for my birthday. It bugs me when people find out that my birthday is on Valentine’s Day and I get the “oh no, your poor boyfriend must hate that!” I think you guys should compromise to celebrate both the holiday AND his birthday. 
Watch a cheesy Valentine’s Day movie on Netflix and take a shot every time they do something cliché. 16. Pretend you’re on Top Chef and cook a meal for each other using random ingredients. 17. Make heart-shaped charcuterie boards (heart-chuterie?) to enjoy while you binge-watch something new. 18. 
I think with Valentine's Day its better to lean into their interests. You can make most things related to cheesy romance / Valentine's Day with the right puns or packaging. My husband likes ropes and tying knots. I got him The Ashley Book of Knots, wrapped the book, and tied long lengths of folded paracord into a bow. 
Agreed! She has likely had and will have plenty of great birthdays to offset this one "bad" one. Same with Valentine's day. And if she chooses to, in the future she will have an anniversary with someone who wants to celebrate their time together. Not wanting to hurt someone's feelings is a poor excuse to not offer them respect and honesty. 
Hey Valentine's Day is my birthday too! It's awesome when you're with someone cause all the pressure is on her but when you're single Valentine's Day can be doubly lonely. Pro-tip: If you try and take a nice sweet girl out for dinner on Valentine's day and the restaurant is all booked up. 
I'm a Valentine's baby too, and as it draws closer I know that again I'll be alone not only on Valentine's day, but my birthday, too. Every day it gets closer, I feel worse. I just wonder why can't I just die rather than some innocent joy-filled person. 
Last year I announced we would celebrate his birthday on the correct date except in September. He thought that was odd, however he loved the gifts, card and cake! Later he said this was the first birthday that he felt was All about him. For his actual birthday I gave him a card and a homemade cheesecake. No presents though. 
But in my past relationships Valentine’s Day was never acknowledged or celebrated in an “aweeee ️” way. So now that Valentine’s Day is coming I just don’t want to celebrate it at all, I told my boyfriend that I just want to act like it’s a regular day. And that we shouldn’t do anything crazy for Valentine’s Day . 
It makes you want love all the more, which I think is a good thing. Relationship: be a fucking dork with the person you love. Go all out. Roses, presents, treat them extra special, maybe even organize a day off! Either way, I like Valentine’s Day for what it tries to represent, the celebration of love. 
I'm all for the idea of making Valentine's Day a different day than Feb. 14 though, since on just that specific day, flowers and restaurant prices get jacked up ridiculously, but it would probably be better to give her a heads up that you still intend to have plans. 
For mine and my SO's anniversary (which is only a week and a half off from Valentine's Day), I did a 365 note jar. The idea is that the person gets to open up one note every day for the next year with a message of some sort from you, usually things like your favorite memories with them, reasons you love/appreciate them. 
I've only known mine about 2 years. One of the first things he mentioned within the first 2 months was that he doesn't do birthdays or valentine's day. He said the birthday thing started when he was 11 and no one showed up to his birthday. Since then he doesn't make a big deal of birthdays and actually gets angry when people buy him gifts. </p>
