        <h2><strong>girlfriend said dont get her anything for valentines day watch valentines day the movie</strong></h2>
        <p>Many cultures celebrate Valentine's Day in very different ways, and some don't observe it at all. If that's the case, simply explain to your significant other the importance of this holiday to you. Suggest to celebrate and exchange gifts on a certain day at least a week or two away. [9] 
Not participating in Valentine's Day could look intentional or give your partner the feeling that you don’t really care about them, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who works with men. Advertisement Plus, on Valentine’s Day, your wife or girlfriend is going to be clicking through Instagram story after Instagram story of date nights; over-the  
My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. Your Husband Has Become Lazy in Marriage. This is undoubtedly the most common reason. 
It's easy to feel a bit bummed or even overlooked if you were expecting a little something and it didn't happen, especially on a day like Valentine's Day, which is all about expressing affection. But here's the deal: not everyone views Valentine's Day with the same level of importance, and it doesn't necessarily reflect how she feels about you. 
I just got her a bear and a candy(ik very original) gave it to her on the 13th instead and played it off as a happy february 13th joke. she didn't get me anything but it's fine cus I specifically said not to get me anything. dont let your friends bother you about it too much 
At the end of the day, what truly matters is the connection and love you share with your partner. Valentine's Day is just one day on the calendar, and a gift, or the lack thereof, shouldn't define your relationship. The most valuable thing is the time and effort you both invest in maintaining a strong and loving bond. 
Some quick context my gf (19f) and I (19f) have been together for a couple months and today is obviously valentines. I met up with her a couple days ago cause I knew she would be busy today, so I could give her her gifts. I got her flowers, a hand written note, and I was gonna order her a bear and a necklace. But she hasn’t gotten anything  
Depending on where you live in the South – and what college sports teams you owe allegiance to – your favorite color could be anything from the baby blue of Ole Miss to the royal blue of Kentucky; from the bright orange of Tennessee to the more subdued combination of blue and orange of Auburn; from the cream (don’t call it white) of  
Rather than fight with him about this, what you need to do is to get his attention and then assertively explain to him just how you feel when you don’t receive gifts; your fears about whether you are attractive enough, etc. Ask him to listen and to not comment until you’ve finished speaking. Stop him if he starts commenting before you are done. 
However, handling couple-y events and holidays like Valentine's Day can be a bit complicated. While a more traditional relationship comes with presumed expectations of what February 14 might look like — romantic dinners, flowers, presents, lingerie — a situationship doesn't attach itself to these prescribed rituals. 
I feel a little silly, as I guess men aren’t supposed to expect much for Valentine’s day That's just completely wrong! Valentine's day is about love, not about girlfriends. The fact that many people believe otherwise is a crying shame. Don't go at it with expectations of her making up for it, that's not the point of the conversation. 
She said you don't "have" to get her anything, but she wants you to want to get her something, so do it! And if you don't, I hope you have a comfortable couch. Reply reply 
My girlfriend said to me not to buy her anything for Valentine's Day. She said all she wanted was to have a nice day with me. I still wanted to get her something (figured she'd be secretly upset if I didn't) so I bought her a couple of things. 
Not a holiday like Valentine's day. It's too specific to one person in your life. Most holidays aren't like that. Plus you could unintentionally make the person feel BAD about not having anyone to celebrate that day with. I don't see any good reason to ask unless you like them 
My gf and I have been together for 3 1/2 years, we've not done anything for any Valentine's Day. This time it's even a Tuesday, wtf. However, if you think that just because someone doesn't celebrate Valentine's, that they don't make their gf happy Jeez, so American. We do tons of other stuff over the course of the year. 
So I’ve been on 2 dates with this girl. I like her. We text a lot also. We’ll probably have a third date on Saturday. We don’t know each other super well yet, but I think if the next few dates go well I’d ask her to be my girlfriend. Anyways, I’m not a Valentine’s Day guy at ALL. I don’t think she is either. 
I agree. Even if she says, 'I don't want anything', she will definitely enjoy an event or activity in recognition of her birthday. Flowers, a nice dinner, and a small gift that pertains to an interest of hobby of hers are all good things. 
You can be annoyed that she isn't getting you gifts, but you don't get to be annoyed that she spends her own money. You don't have any right to tell her that's she shouldn't buy herself stuff. Tell her you feel unappreciated. For Valentine's Day, don't do gifts. Do an experience instead-- see a movie, go to dinner, go to a zoo or a park. 
I’m not sure if I’m taking this too deep but I got my boyfriend of 8 months a couple of things for Valentine’s Day, some chocolate, a necklace and made him a card. I used the last of my money this week for all that and gave it too him as soon as I saw him. He didn’t give me anything in return and just said thank you. 
Okay, so I really want to spend Valentine’s Day with my girlfriend (of about 4 months) but she decided that she was going to accept plans with her two friends (male and female) instead of hanging out with me because the female friend didn’t want to be alone on Valentine’s day. </p>
