Homemade Valentine's Day Gift Ideas for a Boyfriend. Your guy and the love you share are one-of-a-kind, so his Valentine's Day gift should be too. Homemade romantic gifts are great for Valentine's Day because they show your love through thought, time, and effort. Get creative and come up with a present no other guy will have. 
Usually for Valentine’s Day I’d send him a huge package with all kinds of LDR themed gifts, but I’m at a total loss for this year. I still want to get him something because I get him something every year and he’s probably going to get me something. What do you even boy your boyfriend, who you see every day, for Valentine’s Day? 
Valentines day is to celebrate love (though I personally thing its commercialized and pointless) So it needs to be more meaningful than just a wrapped gift. It doesn't have to be on that day either, it can be a "this is what we have planned on this day" type deal. Also make sure your partner feels the same way as you do on valentines day.

Hmmm well we do have a photo album but it’s been a little while since I’ve had photos printed and added to it. Maybe it’s time for more! I also like the date idea jar suggestion. Maybe I can do something like that too. I always give him a card for Valentine’s Day and his birthday so I’ll definitely be writing him a letter of sorts too. 
V-Day is just around the corner, and there’s no time like the present to pick out the perfect Valentine’s Day gift. But wait a minute. Should you get your boyfriend a Valentine’s Day gift, or is that holiday only reserved for you to get a gift? In short, the choice truly is up to you. 
Tell your partner that you enjoy celebrating Valentine's Day and were hoping for a gift. Suggest the possibility of an alternative "Valentine's Day" just for the two of you. Be sure to use "I-statements" while discussing the subject. I-statements usually begin with "I feel" and go on to explain your emotions.
