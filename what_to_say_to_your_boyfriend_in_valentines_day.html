Personally I see any regimentation of that kind of thing as deeply dehumanizing. Like you do your valentines day and can say "well, there's my allotted demonstration of romantic affection for the year, back to taking them for granted for the next 364 days of the year". The fact its expected to me makes it utterly worthless. 
All day we see signs in stores, talking about love, posts online, text from friends, chocolate filled hearts aplenty. It ‘ s everywhere and, when your boyfriend forgets Valentine ‘ s Day, the day is horrible. That being said, don ‘ t forget that the day after Valentine ‘ s Day is just another day. Another day when life goes on. 
Roses and chocolates are like soulmate in Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day is not a Valentine’s Day if there is no roses and chocolate. Make it more meaningful by giving your crush your own homemade chocolate. Giving them a box of chocolate spelled I LIKE YOU or their name would be great. Love Letter! </p>
