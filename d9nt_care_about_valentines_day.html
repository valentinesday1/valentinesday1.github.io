        <h2><strong>d9nt care about valentines day cute simple valentines day drawings</strong></h2>
        <p>Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
It’s all about flowers, chocolates, elegant dinners and romantic gestures for many people. For me though I simply don’t give a damn. Perhaps this is how you’ve felt or perhaps you’re simply wondering why so many people seem to value a holiday. Here’s why I dont care about valentines day and I’m sticking to it. 
Here are the top reasons why many couples these days would prefer not to care about Valentine’s Day! 1. Every Day Is Valentine’s Day. Cliche, sure, but still a powerful statement nonetheless. Some couples don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day because they feel as though they don’t need to assign romantic gestures and performances for just  
“I’d gladly take someone who doesn’t show up with flowers on Valentine’s Day for someone who folds the laundry, who gets up in the middle of the night with our babies, who shows up day in and day out in a million other smaller, often unnoticed, ways.” You see, the type of relationship I’m looking to be in isn’t built on holidays. 
Reject the pressure and just practice self-care. Don't get me wrong: Just because I am not down with Valentine's Day, doesn't mean I don't love, well, love. I really do. But I believe in loving on  
For the past six years, my partner and I have tried to do Valentine’s Day “right”: We’ve gone all-in with thoughtful (yet costly) gifts, overpriced dinners booked weeks in advance, and  
Valentine’s Day is never the only time to “claim your independence.” Something we all have in common is the need to prioritize self-love. Use Valentine’s Day — and everyday, for that matter — to focus on yourself. After all, you can’t fully love someone else if you don't love yourself first. 
Valentine's Day on social media feels like an Instagram highlight—you only share the best of the best, and the rest don't make the cut. Hidden from that double-tap worthy carousel full of sweet photos is that adorable messy-just-out-of-bed selfie your partner took to greet you good morning. 
Consider the first Valentine's Day of our marriage.I awoke with a flurry of expectation. I was ready. Ready for my husband to stun me with his love and creativity. 
While the concept of the “Valentine’s Day Blues” has not been extensively studied, it is an idea deeply rooted in pop psychology and is quite common. According to a recent report, the “increasing commodification of romance” and the societal pressure of Valentine’s Day can evoke stress just like holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving. 
Making an effort on Valentine's Day is great if you're SO is into it, but if you don't it doesn't mean you don't care about them. The same argument could be made in the reverse. If someone demands stuff on Valentines Day then they don't care about the person who doesn't want to celebrate it. That's why that's flawed logic. 
As is, I only get dates 2x a year - our anniversary in June if I make plans and Double Valentine's Day. Since we started dating when we were young, broke college kids, husband and I celebrate 'Double Valentine's Day' on Feb. 28. Double the fun, half the price! 
10 things women don't want to hear on Valentine's Day – men, take notes 13 February 2025 at 15:16 
235 votes, 178 comments. true. Let’s ignore the “simps” for a moment and focus on the couples that genuinely love each other. 
Here's what men really think about Valentine's Day and what's expected of them every year on February 14. 1. It's a normal day to some. "Just another day." 
People that call Valentine’s Day a “Hallmark holiday” are just trying to justify that they don’t want to celebrate it or spend any money. If you don’t want to celebrate Valentine’s Day, don’t. No one is forcing you. If both you &amp; your wife feel the same way, that makes it easy! 
Pontificate in Shakespearean English: Counteract the dumbness of the day with some pretentious fancy-talk: If all else fails, make your own book jacket : Then throw it at whatever dummiez persist in annoying you about Valentine’s Day: 
Cool. That's probably the most common thing cuz most people break up right before good events like Christmas, New Year's Day and Valentine's Day, from personal experience. So relax, this isn't uncommon at all and don't feel bad due to the few Lucky ones that get it. Not everyone has to make use of luck. 
Happy Valentine’s Day to ALL (even the Valentine’s day haters)!!!! 
Valentine's Day is the one day of the year that you're expected to be better looking, a better lover, a more fascinating conversationalist, the buyer of the perfect gift, and the planner of the  </p>
