        <h2><strong>which candy is good for valentines day valentines day dinner specials near me 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Packed with eight types of Valentine's Day candy (ranging from sour watermelon gummy bears to chocolate hearts), this colorful tackle box from Dylan's Candy Bar makes an excellent gift for a party  
According to Candystore.com’s annual report from 2023, conversation hearts made a stunning comeback, being the top Valentine’s Day candy choice for 17 U.S. states. In second place was heart-shaped boxes of chocolate (11 states), then seasonal M&amp;M’s (seven states) and Hershey’s Kisses (seven states). 
According to CandyStore.com, in 2020, Valentine's Day candy sales were projected to hit $2.4 billion.That's certainly not a number to scoff at. It's clear that at least some romantics love their Valentine's Day candy, whether reaching for chocolates or a confection with more of a fruity flavor. 
It also doesn’t include the Swedish candy all over TikTok or other fancy, niche candy. These belong in a ranking all their own. With that in mind, here is the definitive ranking of the best Valentine’s Day candy, taking into consideration taste, novelty, thematic fit, and whether it suits me, personally. Argue with the wall.

In shopping for chocolate on Valentine's Day, start by determining who will be eating the chocolate—it could be a gift to yourself, your partner, your kids, or even a Galentine's Day gift for your best friend. That will help narrow down the shape, size, and type of chocolates you want to buy. 
For some, chocolate and Valentine’s Day go hand in hand — according to a 2023 survey from RetailMeNot, 34% of Americans in relationships want to receive chocolate as a gift during the holiday  
Nowadays, the options for Valentine's Day candy extend far past the original heart-shaped box of chocolates and conversation hearts (though we're still big fans of the classics!).
