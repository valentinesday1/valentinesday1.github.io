        <p>One month later on White Day (March 14), men are expected to return gifts that are at least two or three times more valuable than the gifts received in Valentine's Day. The term sanbai gaeshi (‰∏âÂÄçËøî„Åó?, literally, "thrice the return") is used to describe this rule. 
In the 1970s and 1980s, many candy companies made Valentine's Day a big deal. White Day, however, began in Japan in 1978 as a way for men to return gifts to women who gave them chocolates on Valentine's Day (of course we HAVE to be politeü§≠, so we invented „Éõ„ÉØ„Ç§„Éà„Éá„Éº). White Day happens 1 month after Valentine‚Äôs Day, on March 14th.

White chocolate and marshmallows are popular reciprocal gifts given to women on White Day, alongside cosmetics and jewellery. And, while people no longer necessarily subscribe to the convention of sanbai gaeshi (triple the return), White Day gifts are usually expected to be of higher value than those received on Valentine‚Äôs Day. 
It falls on March 14th, exactly one month after Valentine‚Äôs Day. On Valentine‚Äôs Day, women in Japan traditionally give gifts to men, and White Day is when men reciprocate by giving gifts to women. The gifts exchanged on White Day are typically white-colored, hence the name. 
The origins of Valentine's Day are rooted in ancient Roman and Christian traditions, evolving over the years into a celebration of romantic love.
