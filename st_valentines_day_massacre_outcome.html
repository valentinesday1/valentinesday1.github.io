St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, mass murder of a group of unarmed bootlegging gang members in Chicago on February 14, 1929. The bloody incident dramatized the intense rivalry for control of the illegal liquor traffic during the Prohibition era in the United States.

According to reports, the killers were possibly police officers who had tricked their victims into believing they faced a routine arrest. However, it soon became apparent that it was

A Complete Guide to The St Valentine’s Day Massacre of 1929. It was a cold and chilly morning in Chicago, the time was 10:30 a.m. and the date was February 14, 1929. This day would not only mark one of the most brutal mob killings in history, but it would also end the North and South side battle for power. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre occurred about 10:30 a.m. on February 14, 1929, inside the S.M.C. Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street on the north side of Chicago. Seven men associated with George “Bugs” Moran’s bootlegging operation were waiting inside the garage, presumably for a meeting to buy a hijacked shipment of  
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre actually proved to be the last confrontation for both Capone and Moran. Capone was jailed in 1931 and Moran lost so many important men that he could no longer  
On February 15, 1936, nearly seven years to the day of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, McGurn was gunned down at a bowling alley. Bugs Moran was quite shaken from the entire incident. He stayed in Chicago until the end of Prohibition and then was arrested in 1946 for some small-time bank robberies.

The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre marked a turning point in public opinion regarding organized crime. While the violence between criminal factions had been an ongoing concern, the audacity of the massacre, carried out in broad daylight, horrified the public and galvanized law enforcement efforts to combat the rampant criminal activity. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Feb. 14th, 1929. Seven men machine-gunned to death in Chicago. Al Capone was suspected, but as The Mob Museum will show you, nothing was what it seemed. 
A commercial garage on the north side of Chicago was the setting for the most horrific shooting in Mob history, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. On February 14, 1929, seven members and associates of George “Bugs” Moran’s bootlegging gang were lined up against a wall and shot dead inside the garage at 2122 North Clark Street. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Feb. 14th, 1929. Seven men machine-gunned to death in Chicago. Al Capone was suspected, but as The Mob Museum will show you, nothing was what it seemed. 
The priority was to not only stop Al Capone but to put a halt on organized crime and other mobsters. After all that Al Capone did it comes as a huge surprise to find out that 2 years after the St. Valentines Day Massacre he was sentenced to prison on October 17, 1931 for nonetheless than tax evasion. 
The day after the massacre, a coroner's jury watched police reenact the killings at the scene of the crime. For more photos, see the gallery ». At around 10:30 in the morning on February 14th, a  
St. Valentine’s Day Massacre Evidence. On the chilly winter morning of February 14, 1929, four men entered SMC Cartage Company garage in Chicago. Seven members of Bugs Moran’s gang were lined up against the wall and shot. The men opened fire with two Thompson submachine guns and a shotgun. All seven were shot dead. 
The scheme, along with the lives of many participants in what is now known in racing circles as the “St. Valentine’s Day Massacre,” was well on its way to unraveling. 
As far as mass murders go, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre is one of the trickiest, best-crafted slaughters of the 1920s. The year was 1929; the day was Valentine's Day, and all was quiet in Bugs Moran's place of operation, the SMC Cartage Co. garage, located at 2122 North Clark Street in Chicago.
