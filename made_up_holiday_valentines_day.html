Everyone loves a good love story, but the history of Valentine's Day is a bit different from the romanticized version of the holiday recognized today. While February 14 is widely celebrated with sweet Valentine's Day treats, heartfelt Valentine's Day gifts, and romantic dinners, few people are familiar with the holiday's true origins. 
Some contend that he designated the celebration of St. Valentine's Day on February 14 to replace the pagan holiday. When did Valentine's Day become a romantic holiday? If you're thinking that none of this sounds very lovey-dovey, that's because Valentine's Day did not begin to resemble the romantic holiday we know it as today until the Middle  
According to Kelly, author of “Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine,” the English writer was the first to make the connection to love — but he was talking about another St. Valentine whose feast day was May 3. To commemorate King Richard II’s engagement on that day in 1381, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a love poem.

Where does the name Valentine come from?. The holiday is aptly named after Saint Valentine, but who exactly was he?
