        <p>Another option for a relaxed first date on Valentine's Day is to avoid the crowds altogether by staying at home.

Watch a cheesy Valentine’s Day movie on Netflix and take a shot every time they do something cliché. 16. Pretend you’re on Top Chef and cook a meal for each other using random ingredients. 17. Make heart-shaped charcuterie boards (heart-chuterie?) to enjoy while you binge-watch something new. 18. 
In my adult age, going out with someone on Valentine's Day means that I actually care about them in some sense and want to pursue something more with them.
