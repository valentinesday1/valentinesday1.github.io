        <h2><strong>the history of st valentines day valentines day quotes love for husband</strong></h2>
        <p>The history of Valentine's Day—and the story of its patron saint—is shrouded in mystery. We do know that February has long been celebrated as a month of romance, and that St. Valentine’s Day  
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the origins of this festival of candy and cupids are actually dark, bloody — and a bit muddled. 
The Feast of Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine's Day, was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of the Christian martyr. [41] A shrine of Saint Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland. February 14 is Saint Valentine's Day in the Lutheran calendar of saints. [12] 
The association of Valentine's Day with love and romance can be traced back to the 14th century, particularly through the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Chaucer, in his poem "Parliament of Foules," for the first time linked the tradition of courtly love with the feast of St. Valentine, suggesting that birds chose their mates on this particular day. 
The history of Valentine's Day can be traced back to ancient Roman and Christian traditions, evolving over centuries into the celebration of love and affection that we recognize today. Despite its commercialization, many people view Valentine's Day as an opportunity to express their love and appreciation for their partners, friends, and family members. Pagan Origins 
But, since his contemporaries were more familiar with the Feb. 14 Saint Valentine’s Day, that was the date that became attached to the new holiday of romance. In some ways, that may be a good thing. 
The popular customs of showing love and affection on St. Valentine’s Day is almost a coincidence with the feast day of the saint: During the Medieval Age, a common belief in England and France was that birds began to pair on Feb.14, “half-way through the second month of the year.” 
The Catholic Church might have established St. Valentine's Day to honor these two martyrs. Legend says that one of these men, Saint Valentine of Terni, had officiated weddings for Roman soldiers in secret, going against the emperor's wishes, making him seen to some as a proponent of love. 
Bearing cards, flowers, chocolates and poetry, lovers have always swooned on Valentine’s Day as cherubs circled overhead. Right? Or is the history darker, marked by Roman bacchanalia, martyrs and lies? Innumerable legends claim to explain the origins of Valentine’s Day, but as is the case with legends, they leave many questions unanswered. 
Natalia Ganelin/Getty Images. Before the 14th century, St. Valentine's Day was primarily about honoring a Christian martyr. The English poet Geoffrey Chaucer is credited with connecting St. Valentine's Day to the idea of romance. 
Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It may have had beginnings in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which celebrated the coming of spring and included fertility rites and other activities, but the origin of the holiday is vague at best. 
Saint Valentine is the name of one or two legendary Christian martyrs whose lives seem to have a historical basis. Celebrated on February 14, Valentine is venerated as the patron saint of lovers, people with epilepsy, and beekeepers. 
Thank you for downloading this great Valentine’s Day freebie!!! I hope you and your students really enjoy this nonfiction reading activity. The history on Valentine’s Day is murky. I took information from several different sources and checked dates and facts. Since most of this is legend it is difficult to report with 100% accuracy. 
After Pope Gelasius I created St. Valentine’s Day, the festival turned into a Christian celebration that focused on the saint. The Catholic Church doesn’t recognize St. Valentine’s Day on its calendar anymore, but people throughout the world still celebrate the day. CHANGING TRADITIONS 
The History of Valentine’s Day. The earliest potential origin of Valentine’s Day dates back to the pagan festival of Lupercalia, which took place in the middle of February and celebrated  
Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in  
The history of the St. Valentine’s Day celebrations appears to have its roots in a pagan fertility festival known as Lupercalia. Celebrated in ancient Rome between 13 – 15 February, the festival is said to have involved lots of naked folk running through the streets spanking the backsides of young women with leather whips, supposedly to  
Also in Hamlet, Act IV, Scene 5, Ophelia makes mention of Saint Valentine’s Day. To-morrow is Saint Valentine’s day, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be your Valentine. Then up he rose, and donn’d his clothes, And dupp’d the chamber-door; Let in the maid, that out a maid. Never departed more. 
Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine of Rome, is a historical figure who is associated with the celebration of Valentine's Day. In early Christian history, there were several martyrs named Valentine, and scholars still debate the true identity of the Saint Valentine who inspired the holiday. 
While some details of St. Valentine's life are lost to history, the local diocese believes he was the martyred third-century bishop of Terni. A special Mass was celebrated at the basilica February 10 for engaged couples in advance of Valentine's Day. (CNS photo/Paul Haring) (February 12, 2013) </p>
