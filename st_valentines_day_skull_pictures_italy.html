        <p>St. Valentine‚Äôs skull in the minor basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, Italy.  Italy, Feb 1, 2022 / 02:00 am. When most people think of romantic love, a third-century skull crowned  
All Italy Rome St. Valentine's Skull  St. Valentine‚Äôs skull  Pope Gelasius I made February 14‚Äîoriginally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia‚Äîa feast day dedicated to St. Valentine. 
This confusion is compounded by the number of skulls and skull fragments dotted throughout Catholic churches from Poland to Ireland. But I like to believe this one, right here, is the real deal. Isn‚Äôt that romantic? Santa Maria in Cosmedin Piazza della Bocca della Verit√†, 18, 00186 Roma, Italy. Open: Everyday, 9:30 am ‚Äì 6:00 pm. 
Known as the patron saint of couples for his defense of Christian marriage, St. Valentine was martyred by decapitation on Feb. 14. He is also the inspiration behind the modern-day celebration of Valentine‚Äôs Day. And his skull can be venerated in the minor basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin near the Circus Maximus in Rome. 
The skull of St Valentine (we leave it up to you to decide which Valentino exactly) can be visited at the Basilica di S. Maria in Cosmedin, in Piazza Bocca della Verit√† 18, every day from 09.30 to 17.50. Photo Wanted in Rome 
February 14th is the feast day of St Valentine of Terni, the patron saint of lovers &amp; (what is much less well known) beekeepers. The church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin is home to, what it claims to be, the skull of the third century saint. Valentine's Day as a lovers' festival dates back to as early as the 14th century. 
As a saint, Valentine first gained real notoriety in 496 when Pope Gelasius I made Feb. 14 originally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia, a feast day dedicated to St. Valentine. 
The Catholic Church honored this martyrdom by making February 14 a day to remember St. Valentine. St. Valentine‚Äôs Skull‚Äîit is unknown whose skull is actually on display in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. It could be the head of the one or two martyrs named Valentine whom the day is named after (who were in Rome at the right time).

Rome, Italy, Feb 14, 2021 / 02:00 am (CNA).- When most people think of romantic love, a third-century skull crowned with flowers probably does not spring to mind -- nor the story behind it. But a  
Discover the intriguing story of St. Valentine, the mysterious figure behind Valentine's Day. Explore his life, martyrdom, and how he became the patron saint of love and romance. Valentine's Day, a celebration of love and affection, is inextricably linked to the figure of St. Valentine. 
The skull belonged to St. Valentine, a famous Roman saint celebrated on February 14th. If those tourists had only known, in the dawn of another Valentine‚Äôs Day, that they were passing by the patron saint of love himself, I wonder if their Instagram feeds would have looked differently. 
Romance doesn‚Äôt always have to be serious; sometimes, laughter is the best way to show you care. From witty one-liners to sarcastic takes on love, these funny Valentine‚Äôs Day quotes will add a little humor to your celebrations, whether you‚Äôre madly in love, happily single, or somewhere in between. 
The skull was discovered during an excavation of a catacomb that took place in Rome in the early 1800s; the dig yielded the skeletal remains and other relics that are now associated with St. Valentine. Knowing just precisely whose skull it is, however, is muddled. For one thing, there was more than one Catholic holy person known as Saint Valentine. 
More Places To Celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day In Italy Valentine‚Äôs Day in Terni. Terni‚Äôs Festa di San Valentino celebrates the holiday in the home of St. Valentine himself. The highlights include: the Cioccolentino (combo of chocolate and valentine) festival; the St. Valentine‚Äôs marathon; a St. Valentine‚Äôs market; concerts 
Myth and mystery shroud third-century Catholic martyr St. Valentine, who is believed to have been executed on February 14. His skull is said to be housed in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin  
Visit the beautiful, medieval Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and you can view the skull of St. Valentine (or possibly the skull of a different St. Valentine). There were many St. Valentine‚Äôs throughout history but the one people celebrate in honor of today could be the patron recognized by the Roman Catholic Church who died around 270 AD.
