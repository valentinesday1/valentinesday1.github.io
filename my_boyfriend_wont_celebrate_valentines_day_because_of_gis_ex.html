        <h2><strong>my boyfriend wont celebrate valentines day because of gis ex valentines day buns</strong></h2>
        <p>So Valentine's Day is coming up and even though we have only been talking for a month, I figured having a couple drinks together or doing something cute would be a great way to spend the day together. He tells me he doesn't "Celebrate Valentine's Day" because the year before (2020) on Valentine's Day his ex fiance left him. 
My gf and I have been together for 3 1/2 years, we've not done anything for any Valentine's Day. This time it's even a Tuesday, wtf. However, if you think that just because someone doesn't celebrate Valentine's, that they don't make their gf happy Jeez, so American. We do tons of other stuff over the course of the year. 
Valentine's Day isn't to make up for being an absent/crappy partner all yearValentine's Day is to celebrate all you accomplish as a functional couple together. If you switch your mindset a little, these (don't get me wrong, very necessary) revelations about you feeling unloved/unsupported won't happen on Valentine's Daythey'll happen before. 
But Whether he celebrates it or not , he should still spend the day with you to show he appreciates you , he sounds like a cheap ass so his best bet would be to make you something or write you a letter , the fact that he doesn’t want to do anything with you just shows he doesn’t really appreciate you and you are just a convenience to him  
All day we see signs in stores, talking about love, posts online, text from friends, chocolate filled hearts aplenty. It ‘ s everywhere and, when your boyfriend forgets Valentine ‘ s Day, the day is horrible. That being said, don ‘ t forget that the day after Valentine ‘ s Day is just another day. Another day when life goes on. 
Consider the first Valentine's Day of our marriage.I awoke with a flurry of expectation. I was ready. Ready for my husband to stun me with his love and creativity. 
As Valentine’s Day approached the first year my now husband and I were dating, I told him I didn’t want flowers. I could tell by his face that he wasn’t sure if this was a trick of sorts, perhaps a test of his romantic potential. “I’m serious. If you’re going to get me anything, get me something I actually want: Swedish Fish,” I said. 
Since valentine came on Tuesday this year, I don't think its a huge deal if he didn't take the day off as it kinds fucks up the week. Personally I prefer celebrating my birthdsy over valentine because my birthday is about me, and Valentine's is about everyone. 
"Personally, I've never been into Valentine's Day and my guy isn't either. Last year we just spent the day lazy in bed and went out for dinner. We didn't do a big show of it, just a simple weekend  
I feel like there's a reason we came back together and the one year thing is a big deal to me. We didn't do ANYTHING for Valentine's day because he said he didn't have money and he doesn't wanna celebrate our anniversary for the same reason. But to me it isn't about money, I'd be happy going for a hike together and either making something for  
I really like Valentine’s Day and I want to be able to celebrate it but my boyfriend does not. He thinks it’s dumb and someone’s love for someone shouldn’t be summed up into one day. This always leads into fights with us mainly because he won’t compromise to at least say happy Valentine’s Day to each other. 
This is my first boyfriend. He says that he doesn't like Valentine's Day at all. He said he won't buy me flowers or a teddy bear or chocolates or anything like that or go do anything romantic together. 
Here's what you should do if you want to celebrate Valentine's Day but your partner loathes it — or vice versa 
My boyfriend has had many girlfriends before me, and I've only have two boyfriends before him. Several of his previous girlfriends have broken up with him on Valentine’s Day. Because of this he hates the holiday, and won't celebrate it with me. He says it's because I just moved out and don't have the money to do anything, and he doesn't want to. 
So i was a bit upset because my boyfriend doesn’t ever celebrate holidays or our anniversary despite me saying these things are important to me. In our 3+ year relationship, he hasn’t said happy Valentine’s Day or done anything for Valentine’s Day, hasn’t done anything for our anniversary, only said happy anniversary after I said it. 
This is a repost. The original post is by u/throwrastayhungry. This post has reached one of our comment/karma limits. The text of the post has been preserved below. I (27F) have been dating my BF (26M) since last summer, about 7 months now. 
My parents have been married for over 30 years. My father never forgotten a birthday or anniversary. He still takes my mom out on dates and buys her gifts. He makes Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Christmas, hell even Halloween a big deal. 
My boyfriend is terrible about romance and showing affection and love. And he’s 48 and way stuck in his ways. But he actively does things out of his comfort zone because he knows they make me happy. As he knows that I have adapted to his love language so it’s only fair that he adapts to mine. Because we compromise. Talk to your boyfriend  
I wouldn't ever get so much as an "I had fun" or a "thanks for a fun day" or anything like that. He bought me gifts our first Christmas together and then that was that. It was "just another day". I couldn't celebrate his birthday because he "didn't like attention". I got a card for mine. </p>
