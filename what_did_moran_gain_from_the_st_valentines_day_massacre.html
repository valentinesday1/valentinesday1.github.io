        <p>Her book got the “blessing” from Dean O’Banion’s nephew. This man was instrumental in persuading Bugs Moran’s son to speak to Keefe for her second book. The Man Who Got Away: The Bugs Moran Story, published in March of 2005. Why does the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre still fascinate people? 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre shocked the world on February 14, 1929, when Chicago’s North Side erupted in gang violence. Seven men associated with the Irish gangster George “Bugs  
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre actually proved to be the last confrontation for both Capone and Moran. Capone was jailed in 1931 and Moran lost so many important men that he could no longer  
The St. Valentine‘s Day Massacre, as it came to be known, saw seven members of George "Bugs" Moran‘s North Side Gang lined up against a wall inside a Lincoln Park garage and riddled with 70 rounds of ammunition by four unknown assassins, at least two of whom were dressed as police officers. 
As the culmination of a gang war between famous rivals Al ‘Scarface’ Capone and George ‘Bugs’ Moran, the bloody events of the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre were splashed across the world’s media and came to symbolise the violence of the prohibition era in Chicago. Chicago was the crime capital of America 
Released in 1957, Moran didn't have long to enjoy his freedom - he was arrested again almost immediately on more robbery charges. The last survivor of the St Valentine’s Day Massacre eventually died of lung cancer in prison just a few months into a 10-year prison sentence. 
O n February 14, 1929, four men dressed as police officers enter gangster Bugs Moran's headquarters on North Clark Street in Chicago, line seven of Moran's henchmen against a wall, and shoot them to death. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, as it is now called, was the culmination of a gang war between arch rivals Al Capone and Bugs Moran. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre occurred about 10:30 a.m. on February 14, 1929, inside the S.M.C. Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street on the north side of Chicago. Seven men associated with George “Bugs” Moran’s bootlegging operation were waiting inside the garage, presumably for a meeting to buy a hijacked shipment of  
St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, mass murder of a group of unarmed bootlegging gang members in Chicago on February 14, 1929. The bloody incident dramatized the intense rivalry for control of the illegal liquor traffic during the Prohibition era in the United States. 
The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre is the name given to the shooting of seven people (six of them gangsters) as part of a Prohibition Era conflict between two powerful criminal gangs in Chicago, Illinois, in the winter of 1929: The South Side Italian gang led by Al "Scarface" Capone and the North Side Irish/German gang led by George "Bugs" Moran. 
On February 15, 1936, nearly seven years to the day of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, McGurn was gunned down at a bowling alley. Bugs Moran was quite shaken from the entire incident. He stayed in Chicago until the end of Prohibition and then was arrested in 1946 for some small-time bank robberies. 
On St. Valentine's Day, most of the Moran gang had already arrived at the warehouse by approximately 10:30 AM. Moran was not there, having left his Parkway Hotel apartment late. As Moran and one of his men, Ted Newberry, approached the rear of the warehouse from a side street they saw the police car pull up. 
Jack McGurn was a suspect in the Massacre but he had a “blonde alibi”: girlfriend Louise Rolfe. Courtesy of John Binder Collection A leading account has McGurn setting up the Massacre by tricking the Moran gang members into showing up at the Clark Street garage to take a delivery of Canadian whiskey hijacked from Capone. 
Notorious Chicago | St. Valentine’s Day Massacre Chicago Tribune, February 22, 1929 The discovery last night of the automobile believed to have been used in the Moran gang massacre produced clews, names, identifications, and arrests and the belief the right trail has been found—as the eyeglasses led to the exposure of Leopold and Loeb. 
On St Valentine’s Day morning in 1929, a group of Moran’s men were huddled in a garage used to repair the gang’s vehicles. It was quite a cross-section of characters, ranging from hard-bitten gangsters like Frank and Peter Gusenberg – two brothers who were among Moran’s most violent and notorious trigger-men – to criminal accountant Adam Heyer, to the relatively blameless John May  
St. Valentine’s Day Massacre Evidence. On the chilly winter morning of February 14, 1929, four men entered SMC Cartage Company garage in Chicago. Seven members of Bugs Moran’s gang were lined up against the wall and shot. The men opened fire with two Thompson submachine guns and a shotgun. All seven were shot dead. 
On Feb. 14, 1929, seven men were lined up against the wall in a North Side garage and gunned down execution-style. The infamous mob hit became known as the St. Valentine’s Day massacre. Five  
The site of the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre is among the most infamous in Chicago history. Yet today, if one visits the Chicago neighborhood where it happened no physical relics or reminders remain of the legendary massacre. 
Although Capone bodyguard Jack McGurn was never prosecuted in the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, the theory endures that he was its mastermind. For one thing, if Capone was behind the Massacre, it seems likely he would have had McGurn handle the details. Also, McGurn would have had good reason to go after members of Bugs Moran’s gang. 
The day after the massacre, a coroner's jury watched police reenact the killings at the scene of the crime. For more photos, see the gallery ». At around 10:30 in the morning on February 14th, a  </p>
