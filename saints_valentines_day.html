        <h2><strong>saints valentines day happy valentines day wich you</strong></h2>
        <p>Saint Valentine is the name of one or two legendary Christian martyrs whose lives seem to have a historical basis. Celebrated on February 14, Valentine is venerated as the patron saint of lovers, people with epilepsy, and beekeepers. 
Two Valentines are listed in the Roman Martyrology for February 14. The first Saint Valentine was a Roman priest who reportedly was martyred on the Flaminian Way during the reign of the Emperor Claudius. The other Saint Valentine was a third-century bishop of Terni who was martyred in Rome but whose relics were sent back to his home see. 
The romantic nature of Valentine's Day may have derived during the Middle Ages, when it was believed that birds paired couples in mid-February. According to English 18th-century antiquarians Alban Butler and Francis Douce, Valentine's Day was most likely created to overpower the pagan holiday, Lupercalia. 
The Feast of Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine's Day, was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of the Christian martyr. [41] A shrine of Saint Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland. February 14 is Saint Valentine's Day in the Lutheran calendar of saints. [12] 
Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in  
The history of Valentine's Day—and the story of its patron saint—is shrouded in mystery. We do know that February has long been celebrated as a month of romance, and that St. Valentine’s Day  
St. Valentine, patron saint of Terni, Italy. In the Italian city of Terni, Catholics look forward to February 14 as the feast day of St. Valentine, their city’s patron saint, whose relics are  
It was Chaucer’s work that popularized the celebration of St. Valentine’s Day in England. The celebration then spread to France and the rest of Europe. Our Feb. 14 celebrations of the saint – actually there are records of at least four saints named Valentine – tend toward romantic dinners, kisses and heart-shaped chocolates. 
The popular customs connected with Saint Valentine’s Day undoubtedly had their origin in a conventional belief generally received in England and France during the Middle Ages, that on February 14, i.e. half way through the second month of the year, the birds began to pair. Thus in Chaucer’s “Parliament of Foules” we read: 
While speaking of the amorous flavor of Valentine’s Day, no mention is made of the saint. While it seems that the exchange of “valentines” is more the result of secular custom rather than the memory of St. Valentine, and that the celebration has been further paganized with cupids and the like, there is a Christian message that should be  
St. Valentine, a name that is synonymous with love and romance across the globe, lived at a time when the Roman Empire was at its zenith. He is often best remembered for the act of marrying couples in secret defiance of the Roman Emperor's bans. However, the truth about St. Valentine is far more complex, woven from a mixture of historical fragments, religious tradition, and folklore. This has  
As far as we can tell, the Saint Valentine of Valentine’s Day was one of two guys preaching the good word in Rome in the third century (Valentine of Rome or Valentine of Terni). One of these two was martyred on February 14th 269, thus giving us the date for his eponymous day. How a Pagan Festival Inspired Valentine’s Day Traditions 
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the ancient Romans had bloodier, drunker and more naked notions to mark the occasion. 
The Catholic Church doesn’t recognize St. Valentine’s Day on its calendar anymore, but people throughout the world still celebrate the day. CHANGING TRADITIONS. Valentine’s Day traditions have evolved a lot over the years. For example, in the Middle Ages—which lasted from the 5th to 15th centuries in Europe—people started exchanging  
But Saint Valentine’s feast day didn’t used to be a big to-do — which should please those who think too much is being made of it now. “Valentine was not one of the more important saints  
But, since his contemporaries were more familiar with the Feb. 14 Saint Valentine’s Day, that was the date that became attached to the new holiday of romance. In some ways, that may be a good thing. 
Valentine’s Day is observed on February 14 in honor of Saint Valentine, a Christian martyr who was executed on this day for secretly performing marriages. Over time, the day became associated  
The incident became known as “the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre” and has been depicted in numerous movies ever since, including Scarface and Some Like it Hot. One victim, Frank Gusenberg, was still alive for a short time after the shooters fled the scene. 
The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre was the murder of seven members and associates of Chicago's North Side Gang on Saint Valentine's Day 1929. The men were gathered at a Lincoln Park, Chicago , garage on the morning of February 14, 1929. </p>
