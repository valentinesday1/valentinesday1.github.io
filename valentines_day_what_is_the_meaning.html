Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in  
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the ancient Romans had bloodier, drunker and more naked notions to mark the occasion.

And whether that happens over heart-shaped cookies, a scavenger hunt, or an extra bedtime snuggle, the real Valentine’s Day magic is in those everyday acts of love. 
Color Dress Code for Valentine’s Day. 1. Red Color – I’m in Love . First, in our list of color dress codes on Valentine’s Day is the lovely color red, which symbolizes love and romance.

However, it’s important that we keep it authentic. Valentine’s Day doesn’t need to be a public declaration. 
As we continue to think more carefully about the meaning of Valentine’s Day, how about the very idea of love? Valentine’s Day encourages the idea that the occasional grand gesture of love
