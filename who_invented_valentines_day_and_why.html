        <h2><strong>who invented valentines day and why writing on valentines day candies</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in  
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts  
Valentine’s Day did not come to be celebrated as a day of romance until about the 14th century. ( Read Britannica’s essay “Why Do We Give Valentine Cards?” Why the history of Valentine's Day is so complicated Learn how St. Valentine, an ancient Roman festival, and the poet Geoffrey Chaucer all contribute to the history of Valentine's Day. 
The History of Valentine's Day, and Why We Celebrate. Valentine’s Day may be associated with romance, but the history of the holiday isn’t exactly lovey-dovey. Here are the facts you may not know—plus, fun ideas for Valentine's Day 2025. 
Who invented Valentine’s Day and why? Pope Gelasius I technically invented Valentine’s Day in AD 496 when he established The Feast of Saint Valentine, in memory of the martyred saint who died on that day over 200 years before. The first known link between Valentine's Day and coupledom was February 14 1400 though. 
The history of Valentine's Day: From its pagan origins to a billion-dollar holiday People might be stressed over getting the perfect flowers or card for their partner. 
Why do we celebrate Valentine's Day today? Valentine's Day's transformation into a holiday about romantic love can be attributed to the Romantic English poet Geoffrey Chaucer. The Times notes that Jack B. Oruch, a late University of Kansas English professor, credits Chaucer for modern ideas about Valentine's Day. Through his research, Oruch  
Therefore, Oruch claimed, Chaucer invented Valentine's Day as we know it today. At the time of Chaucer's writing, February 14 also happened to be considered the first day of spring in Britain, because it was the beginning of birds' mating season — perfectly appropriate for a celebration of affection. 
The history of Valentine's Day can be traced back to ancient Roman and Christian traditions, evolving over centuries into the celebration of love and affection that we recognize today. Despite its commercialization, many people view Valentine's Day as an opportunity to express their love and appreciation for their partners, friends, and family members. Pagan Origins 
Despite the odd mixture of its origins, St. Valentine's Day is now a day for sweethearts. It is the day that you show your friend or loved one that you care. You might send candy to someone you think is special or send roses, the flower of love. Most people send "valentine," a greeting card so named for the notes that St. Valentine received in  
St. Valentine, a name that is synonymous with love and romance across the globe, lived at a time when the Roman Empire was at its zenith. He is often best remembered for the act of marrying couples in secret defiance of the Roman Emperor's bans. However, the truth about St. Valentine is far more complex, woven from a mixture of historical fragments, religious tradition, and folklore. This has  
The Catholic Church doesn’t recognize St. Valentine’s Day on its calendar anymore, but people throughout the world still celebrate the day. CHANGING TRADITIONS. Valentine’s Day traditions have evolved a lot over the years. For example, in the Middle Ages—which lasted from the 5th to 15th centuries in Europe—people started exchanging  
How Valentine’s Day Became a Day of Love While the origins of Valentine’s Day were steeped in martyrdom and early religious traditions, its connection to love and romance grew in the Middle Ages. During this time, it was commonly believed that birds began their mating season on February 14th, reinforcing the idea that this day was meant for  
Valentine's Day is always on February 14th. In 2025, the holiday just so happens to fall on the Friday ahead of a long weekend for most. Monday Feb. 17 is President's Day. Why is Valentine's Day  
Why is Valentine’s Day celebrated on Feb. 14? Kean Collection/Getty Images. The holiday is on Feb. 14 because Christians wanted the church to be separate from Lupercalia. In an effort to clean

The Valentine’s Day tradition of giving a box of candy was started in the 19th century by Richard Cadbury, a scion of a British chocolate manufacturing family. With a new technique recently  
When did Valentine’s Day cards become commercially produced? Valentine’s Day cards started to be mass-produced in the 19th century. Esther A. Howland, an American, is often credited with creating the first commercial Valentine’s Day cards in the 1840s. Why are roses associated with this day? 
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the origins of this festival of candy and cupids are actually dark, bloody — and a bit muddled. 
The first written connection between love and Valentine’s Day appears in his poem, Parlement of Foules, written in the late 14th century.
