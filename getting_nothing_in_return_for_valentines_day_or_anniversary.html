        <h2><strong>getting nothing in return for valentines day or anniversary arguments against valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
Let them know that exchanging small tokens of affection, like gifts or cards, is meaningful to you. Frame it as something that makes you feel cared for, not as a criticism of what you didn’t get. Set the Stage for Valentine’s Day: To avoid disappointment for the next occasion, suggest celebrating it in a way you both enjoy. You could even  
For Valentine’s Day my wife and I spam each other with the cheesiest and most messed up valentines memes we can find. That’s it. That’s all. You probably thought you sounded selfish because getting upset over not getting a gift is childish, greedy and plainly said your pushing your expectations on him for that day isn’t fair either. 
It doesn’t take a genius to know that a sweet gesture for Valentine’s Day, birthday, Mother’s/Father’s Day, Christmas, Anniversary goes a long way with a partner. 5 events in a year with  
There is a sacred power in giving a gift, receiving a gift, and the gift itself. When unencumbered, it can provide abundant joy that feeds a heart more than any other experience. 
Wife married 36 years here. My spouse did many things that HE thought were expressions of affection when we were 1st married. However, he missed my birthday, anniversary, mothers day every damned year. My Birthday is Valentinesfree reminders for 30 days prior. WTF I was hurt over and over for many years. 
In my house, I never agreed to no gifts. And I can tell you for certain, it makes a person feel like shite when they do 95% of the holiday prep work, 95% of the kid shopping, all of the wrapping, careful gift selection for their spouse, help the kids get gifts for their father, and get nothing in return. Repeatedly. 
So maybe you don't live exactly alone. It's good to have a roommate, right? Especially if they're a good roommate, so you don't have to be picking up after them or complaining to your cat. And when you want to have a do-nothing day, they'll be there for you (and you'll be there for them too.) 9. Keeping focused and getting stuff done. Don't  
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
Still, he got you nothing in return. If your boyfriend has seriously dropped the ball on Valentine’s, it is okay to let him know. Just remember, it is always best to try and keep the conversation calm. Let him know that you are hurt that you expressed your desire to celebrate Valentine’s Day with gifts and he didn’t follow through. 
Been married close to 30 years gents, running out of ideas. She doesn’t like flowers that much and doesn’t like jewelry that much. Leaves me with chocolate or a gift box nuts and coffee  
Along with saying g happy birthday on other games as well. On our 1 year anniversary I made a video of me singing thinking out loud by ed Sheeran for her. Valetines day I made a discord bot that would send her reasons I love her every day for 3 months. She got me nothing for any of those events.

I am the romantic one in mine and my husband relationship. He will do nothing for me valentine’s. And I am ok with it. Even on our Anniversary.. I am one that will buy the candy and the gifts. He will scrape the ice off my car in the morning. He will make sure there is a path shoveled to my car for the snow. Little things like that 
I love getting my husband stuff because I get things he normally wants but he won't get for himself. So for Valentine's day I always get him something nice. Like this year I got him a new pair of UGGs , a mug, socks, cards and balloons. Plus it's to celebrate love, we love each other he doesn't only love me. 
Its our one year[F18] anniversary and we talked about what we would get eachother for weeks now. (Its long distance) He [M18]kept asking what I got him since he was super excited over it. Today is our anniversary and I sent him what it was. He was super ecstatic but then I was told he didn't get me anything in return.
