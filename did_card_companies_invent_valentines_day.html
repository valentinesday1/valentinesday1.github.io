        <p>Valentine's Day was invented by greeting card companies. The idea that Valentine's Day, which falls yearly on Feb. 14, was a cynical gambit by greeting card companies, came with a line 
It's commonly believed Valentine's Day was invented by greeting card companies. But, while they've certainly made a mint off it, that is fiction. 
Contrary to popular belief, Hallmark did not invent Valentine’s Day. Initially, Hallmark’s founder, J.C. Hall , began selling Valentine’s Day postcards in 1910. As greeting cards gained popularity, Hallmark began printing its very own greeting cards. 
Today, that same company estimates that 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are sent each year, making Valentine’s Day second only to Christmas in terms of card-sending holidays. 
The myth that Valentine’s Day was created by greeting card companies may persist because we don’t really have a clear idea of where it came from. The origins of Valentine’s Day are 
The idea that Valentine's Day, which falls yearly on Feb. 14, was a cynical gambit by greeting card companies, came with a line of dialogue in the 2004 Jim Carrey/Kate Winslet romance "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." 
Valentines were added to the company’s inventory in 1913. Hallmark began printing its own greeting card designs in 1915. The company’s first Valentine’s Day cards appeared on store shelves in 1916. 
But then came Hallmark cards for Valentine's Day. By 1913, a company by the name of Hallmark moved into the Valentine's Day card business and the rest is history. 
Hallmark, which began offering Valentine's Day cards in 1913, estimates that today, 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are exchanged annually, not including the kids’ valentines popular for  
In 1913 Hallmark Cards produced their first Valentine’s card, representing a key development in the commercialisation of Valentine’s Day. 
They gripe that the holiday is a fabrication devised by greeting card and candy companies to promote consumerism in the retail lull during the post-Christmas slump. It is a lucrative business. After Christmas’ 2.6 billion cards, Valentines is the second most popular holiday for greeting cards with over 1 billion cards sent. 
How many people propose on Valentine’s Day each year? Answer: Around 6 million. What holiday sells more greeting cards than Valentine’s Day? Answer: Christmas. What country celebrates “Friendship Day” instead of Valentine’s Day? Answer: Finland. Which fast-food chain once offered Valentine’s Day dinner reservations? Answer: White  
Worcester does, however, have an important place in the valentine industry’s history. In keeping with the Valentine’s Day tradition, the story of Esther Howland and the card company she created right here in the heart of the commonwealth starts with a bit of (possible) romance. As the local legend goes, Howland received an English valentine. 
Valentine’s Day by the numbers. What percentage of Americans say they celebrate Valentine’s Day? 52%; As of 2023, how much does the average person spend on Valentine’s Day? $193. About how many roses are sent on Valentine’s Day each year? 50 million. Following Valentine’s Day, what is the holiday where the most flowers are sent  
Her distinctive cards are cherished by collectors to this day. Howland did not invent the Valentine’s Day card — handmade versions had been circulating in Europe since at least the 15th  
The company first offered Valentine’s Day cards in 1913 and began producing their own cards in 1916. According to Statistic Brain, 144 million people sent Hallmark cards last Valentine's Day  
Who sent the first Valentine’s Day card? The first known Valentine’s Day card was sent by Charles, Duke of Orleans, to his wife while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London in the early 15th century. However, the tradition of exchanging cards became more widespread in the 18th century. When did Valentine’s Day cards become commercially  
Valentines were added to the company’s inventory in 1913. Hallmark began printing its own greeting card designs in 1915. The company’s first Valentine’s Day cards appeared on store shelves in 1916.

Valentine’s Day Cards Today. Today, Valentine’s Day is the second most popular holiday to send a greeting card (after Christmas), according to the greeting Card Association there are over 150 million Valentine’s Day cards sent each year in the US.
