Whether you’re addressing a congregation of couples, families, or singles, this blog for Valentine’s Day Sermon Outlines provide a framework to inspire and encourage your audience with biblical truths about love. 
Valentine’s Day could easily be claimed as a Christian holiday. I think most people are aware of the fact that Valentine’s Day has roots in Christian popular celebration of God’s gift of romantic love.

Valentine was a Roman Catholic priest who was martyred on February 14, 270 A.D., during the persecution of Emperor Claudius II.

The sermons here–while obviously appropriate for any day of the year–can help you proclaim God’s truth on Valentine’s Day as your congregation is thinking about the supremacy of love. The Perfect Match (Genesis 2:18-25) What is Love? (Song of Solomon 8:6-7) The More Excellent Way (1 Corinthians 12:31-13:3) How Do I Love Thee?

According to Wikipedia, Valentine’s Day originated as a feast to honour the 3rd century Christian martyr, Valentine, later known as St. Valentine. Unfortunately, overtime folk traditions would change this religious feast into a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of love 
February is a perfect time to showcase the different dimensions of the meanings of love. Of course, February features Valentine’s Day on the fourteenth, and speaks to a certain kind of love, eros, which is the common pair of glasses through which many perceive love. But there is much more to the word love than erotic love. 
Preaching Today provides pastors and preachers sermon prep help with sermon illustrations, sermons, sermon ideas, and preaching articles. 
As Valentine’s Day approaches, both husbands and wives have a great, calendared reminder of the importance of speaking love and demonstrating love to one another. Love is the glue that holds the marriage together, and must be expressed every day, not just once a year. Say “I love you” often and mean it. Saying “I love you  
Many have heard these verses recited in wedding ceremonies or seen them written on Valentine’s Day cards. And they are found in 1 Corinthians 13, often called the “love chapter” of the Bible. Love never fails  At a certain point, some might say 1 Corinthians 13 has been quoted too much, which can cause words to lose their meaning. 
Children's Sermon for Valentine's Day (1 John 4:7-12) Look what I have here. (Show the Conversation Hearts candies.) These are called Conversation Hearts. We usually see them around Valentine’s Day and they each have messages of love on them. Let’s read some now. (Read a few of the candies and give one to each child.)

It was especially touching for the widows and widowers of our congregation

Beyond romantic gestures and heartfelt exchanges, the Scriptures offer profound insights into the transformative power of love. Valentine’s Day Bible Verses For Making A Difference Through Love </p>
