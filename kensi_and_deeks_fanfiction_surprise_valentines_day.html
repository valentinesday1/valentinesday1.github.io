Kensi and Deeks brought in some muffins as a special treat, and he and G said "Happy Valentines Day" to Kensi, Nell and Hetty, but that was as far as it went. There were some parts of the mission that had gone a bit overboard with the hearts and cupids decorating motif, but nothing like that was present in the bullpen or upstairs in Ops.

Deeks shook his head when he thought of all the car chases they’d been in and near-accidents they’d had through the years only to have disaster literally strike them, T-boning Kensi’s side of the car as they cruised through an intersection at the speed limit on their way to Valentine’s Day dinner. 
Her last contact with Deeks was a brief text 2 days ago. She grabbed the phone again and scrolled through the messages to read it once more. Deeks – Checking in. U good? Kensi – I’m bored. U? Deeks – Tired. Kensi – When r u coming home? Deeks – Soon. Save me a donut. Kensi – I ate them all. Deeks – What??? Fern, you’ll get fat

“I’ll be anxious to hear what happens,” he said as he handed Deeks his package. “That makes two of us.” 4:30 p.m. – Deeks’ Apartment. Deeks finally showered and trimmed his facial hair a bit. Kensi pretended she didn’t like his scruff, but he thought otherwise. 
But it's Deeks who finally breaks the silence, "I think the kitchen is now my favorite room in this apartment. And just for the record, you can make that frosting anytime, no need to bother with a cake." Kensi snorts in reply then quietly murmurs, "Definitely the best Valentine's I've ever celebrated. Thank you for not making a big deal out of  
Kensi and Deeks were high school sweethearts. They later married, and were ready to start a family. They never knew that one phone call could change their lives forever. Deeks is posted to Afghanistan, and is forced to leave Kensi behind. Never in a thousand years would Kensi believe that the love her life was halfway 
Deeks noticed that Kensi liked one dessert the best and asked the waiter for two servings to go. He smiled and headed to the kitchen. Once they got their to go order Deeks paid and took Kensi's hand in his as they left. "I have a surprise for you at my place." Said Deeks. "Really." Kensi looked at Deeks and smiled. "Yeah." 
"It's the heart that really matters in the end." Stuck on the USS Van Buren for Christmas, Kensi surprises Deeks by not being depressed, and Deeks surprises himself by not being bothered as she dances with other men. And both Kensi and Deeks learn a thing or two about enjoying the good things in life, including a night sky and each other.

She experienced it a few times in the past, getting chocolate, fabric hearts and flowers from Jack, but it was just not her. In the seven years after he left her, she decided to invent a tradition- much like the one she has on Christmas. 
When he turned up bloodstained and covered in soot after the meet building had been blown up, Kensi had to restrain herself from knocking him over in relief. #28 - Dad. When the day came that he decided to tell her about shooting his father, she listened to him without saying a word, thankful that she'd loved her father up until the day he'd died. 
"And now," Deeks began, ignoring the bickering, "where to Miss?" "To the stars." Kensi whispered, quoting the movie. "I'm never helping Deeks again." Sam grumbled as he and Callen went over to the kitchen to prepare Kensi some chicken noodle soup and tea. LALALA. Later that evening, after the team had departed, Deeks and Kensi were lying on the  
"And no panini." Kensi said with her mouth full. "You can't win, Deeks. Just accept it." Sam said with a smile as he clapped Deeks on the shoulder. "Yeah, I should know by now the only way to her heart is through her stomach." Kensi savored her panini while sitting up on her bed. Deeks got some extra chairs so they could all sit with her. 
In this chapter it skips ahead, but Kensi there will be memories for Kensi of what happened after she found out who White Ghost was and what happened to him. CHAPTER 5: THE SURPRISE MARTY'S P.O.V.

"That whole thing with Kensi and Deeks. They seem to know a lot about each others apartments." "I don't know if that's weird. You know my place pretty well." "That's because you don't own anything, G. There's not much to notice." "Hey, I bought a new lamp the other day." "Congratulations. Your home décor is now complete." "Very funny." 
"Because it's exciting! You're going to propose and Kensi has no idea and it's going to be awesome!" "Shhhhh! Take it down a notch. I don't want everyone in LA to hear you." Deeks had dragged Nell into the burn room the first chance he got. She started squealing as soon as she saw the black velvet box he pulled out of his pocket. 
That it was either him or her. That this was the cost of what they did. None of that would help her right now. Kensi and Deeks shared a knowing look. There was only one thing they could do for her now. Kensi sat down next to her, wrapping her arm around her friend. Deeks sat on the other side.
