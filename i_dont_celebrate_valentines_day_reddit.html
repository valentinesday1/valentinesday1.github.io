        <h2><strong>i dont celebrate valentines day reddit new york valentines day lunch</strong></h2>
        <p>People that call Valentine‚Äôs Day a ‚ÄúHallmark holiday‚Äù are just trying to justify that they don‚Äôt want to celebrate it or spend any money. If you don‚Äôt want to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day, don‚Äôt. No one is forcing you. If both you &amp; your wife feel the same way, that makes it easy! 
I'm an incel and I'm not Catholic. Never been in a relationship before so I don't have any reason to celebrate the commercial aspect of it like normal people do, and since I'm not Catholic either I don't have much of a reason to celebrate Valentine's martyrdom as part of my religion. 
Making an effort on Valentine's Day is great if you're SO is into it, but if you don't it doesn't mean you don't care about them. The same argument could be made in the reverse. If someone demands stuff on Valentines Day then they don't care about the person who doesn't want to celebrate it. That's why that's flawed logic. 
For instance, the guy who Redditor CosmicBubblewrap has been seeing for four months recently told her, "Oh, by the way, I don't do Valentines Day.It's a lame Hallmark holiday and I don't like  
The general resentment about Valentine‚Äôs Day on Reddit perhaps shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. According to Pew Research Center , the two most common age demographics of Reddit users are 18-24  
Don't get me wrong: Just because I am not down with Valentine's Day, doesn't mean I don't love, well, love. I really do. But I believe in loving on my own terms and in my own way. 
It matters not how you celebrate this one day, but how you treat your relationship on all the rest. Sure, the big bouquets, giant boxes of chocolate, or bags of Swedish Fish can be fun (and delicious). Just don‚Äôt let them‚Äîor the lack of them‚Äîtake away from the million other meaningful moments that don‚Äôt come packaged quite as prettily. 
9) Find an anti-Valentine's Day party. Odds are that you're not the only one in your circle who doesn't celebrate Valentine's Day. Find a group or set up a dinner with others that feel the same  
Many cultures celebrate Valentine's Day in very different ways, and some don't observe it at all. If that's the case, simply explain to your significant other the importance of this holiday to you. Suggest to celebrate and exchange gifts on a certain day at least a week or two away. [9] 
Valentine‚Äôs Day for the Realists: Funny Relationship Truths ‚ÄúLove is patient, love is kind but mostly, love is remembering to take out the trash.‚Äù ‚ÄúValentine‚Äôs Day: When couples compete to post the cheesiest love captions.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you more than coffee. But please don‚Äôt test that in the morning.‚Äù 
Counterpoint: A lot of the options for fun stuff to eat or do with your partner don't really exist outside of Valentine's day, so you don't really have the option of just doing them whenever. In particular, the vegan high-quality chocolates I like best are really only available a handful of times a year (Christmas, Easter, and Valentine's Day  
Some years we celebrate, some years we don't. We have kind of a monthly cycle of treating each other, and if valentine's day is the day that fits when we are going do a nice date night, we are corny and buy in. But if not, we don't really go out of our way to make valentine's day into something that doesn't really mean anything. 
If you wanted to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day, you should mention that in advance. More generally, if you want the traditional holidays, and dating traditions observed in some way, discuss and be specific about what you do/don‚Äôt like. Goes double for anything you don‚Äôt want. 
We don't celebrate Valentine's Day either because we can celebrate our love all the other day's of the year! When my husband and I were dating, I told him I didn't want to celebrate Valentine's Day and he thought it was a trap, but he soon realized I'm straightforward and don't play games. 
I'm married and we don't even celebrate Valentine's day (doesn't mean anything to us but that's totally our own unconscious decision), it's really up to you what you want to do with the day, and it's nice to have special days. 
We don‚Äôt usually celebrate. I don‚Äôt like flowers and cards. Married 17 years. I did work 2nd shift on a vday a few years ago and my husband drove 30 minutes to my work and left me a single rose and peanut butter cups on my steering wheel. 
Same! I seemingly never have a girlfriend around valentine's day. Valentine's day is really a store created holiday. As a concept valentine's day is really weird. It's a day where you show your partner you love them.. But shouldn't that happen every day regardless. Grand gestures of affection don't need a specific day. 
It‚Äôs on February 14 and called D√≠a de Los Enamorados ( Lovers‚Äô Day) , but it‚Äôs treated as a day to celebrate all love and friendship. So friends and family give each other gifts as well . It‚Äôs most important for couples though and I‚Äôve seen people treating almost like another anniversary. 
Cool. That's probably the most common thing cuz most people break up right before good events like Christmas, New Year's Day and Valentine's Day, from personal experience. So relax, this isn't uncommon at all and don't feel bad due to the few Lucky ones that get it. Not everyone has to make use of luck. 
Today is my birthday so the popularity of St. Valentine's used to low key annoy me because it was quite difficult to find a spot to celebrate if I felt like it: every table in every caf√© seemed to be occupied by romantic dates even on a weekday. üòÖ I don't remember when I started to ignore the "specialty" of the day itself and just going to mom's place over the next weekend with a cake and  </p>
