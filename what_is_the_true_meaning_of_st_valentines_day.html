        <h2><strong>what is the true meaning of st valentines day valentines day photographer pun</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the origins of this festival of candy and cupids are actually dark, bloody — and a bit muddled. 
N owadays, the premise of Valentine’s Day is simple to understand: Feb. 14 is a time to show appreciation for friends, families, significant others and anyone else you might love. Pinpointing  
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts  
Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It may have had beginnings in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which celebrated the coming of spring and included fertility rites and other activities, but the origin of the holiday is vague at best. 
Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in  
St. Valentine, a name that is synonymous with love and romance across the globe, lived at a time when the Roman Empire was at its zenith. He is often best remembered for the act of marrying couples in secret defiance of the Roman Emperor's bans. However, the truth about St. Valentine is far more complex, woven from a mixture of historical fragments, religious tradition, and folklore. This has  
The Feast of Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine's Day, was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of the Christian martyr. [41] A shrine of Saint Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland. February 14 is Saint Valentine's Day in the Lutheran calendar of saints. [12] 
What's the Meaning of Valentine’s Day? Over the centuries, Valentine's Day has been a religious feast day and a secular day of romance. In its earliest incarnation, it was even a ritual celebrating fertility and springtime. Given how much it's changed over time, we say the meaning of Valentine's Day can be whatever you want. 
In a 1981 academic article, the late University of Kansas English professor Jack B. Oruch argued that Chaucer's 1375 poem “Parlement of Foules” was the first to record St. Valentine's Day as a  
According to Kelly, author of “Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine,” the English writer was the first to make the connection to love — but he was talking about another St. Valentine whose feast day was May 3. To commemorate King Richard II’s engagement on that day in 1381, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a love poem. 
Today, Valentine's Day is considered a day of love, but its origin, as discussed above, led to the martyrdom of St. Valentine and is also associated with a pagan festival. 
As far as we can tell, the Saint Valentine of Valentine’s Day was one of two guys preaching the good word in Rome in the third century (Valentine of Rome or Valentine of Terni). One of these two was martyred on February 14th 269, thus giving us the date for his eponymous day. 
In 496 A.D., Pope Gelasius marked February 14 as a day to honor their martyrdom, and a celebration of St. Valentine’s Day was born. In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church removed St. Valentine from the General Roman Calendar because of the lack of reliable information about him. 
Giving valentines. According to the lore, the second St. Valentine didn’t just fall in love with his jailer’s daughter. He also sent her a final farewell letter, signed “from your Valentine.” 
Celebrating Valentine’s Day is for the birds. Or maybe, it would be better to say that celebrating Valentine’s Day is from the birds.. At least one explanation of why the Feast of St. Valentine is considered a day for love and romance has to do with what the Catholic Encyclopedia called “a conventional belief generally received in England and France during the Middle Ages, that on Feb  
While February 14 is widely celebrated with sweet Valentine's Day treats, heartfelt Valentine's Day gifts, and romantic dinners, few people are familiar with the holiday's true origins. You might remember making Valentine's Day crafts at school or picking out cute Valentine's Day candy to share with classmates, but just how did these traditions  
Valentine's Day will be here before you know it. The beginning of the holiday in the middle of February is shrouded in mystery, including who was Saint Valentine since Valentinus was a common name  
Valentine’s Day, in fact, originated as a liturgical feast to celebrate the decapitation of a third-century Christian martyr, or perhaps two. So, how did we get from beheading to betrothing on Valentine’s Day? Early origins of St. Valentine. Ancient sources reveal that there were several St. Valentines who died on Feb. 14. 
Valentine’s Day was further romanticized by poets like Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343–1400) and William Shakespeare (1564–1616), who wrote about love birds and meeting your true love. The first Valentine’s Day greeting cards
