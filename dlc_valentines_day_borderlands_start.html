It's almost Valentine's Day, and that means service games arere starting up their romantic event schedules. It's no different in Borderlands 3, which sees the return of Broken Hearts Day once again. From now until February 25, Vault Hunters will see "mysterious floating hearts swirling around lovesick enemies."

Borderlands 3’s Valentine’s Day-themed event is making a return, with the special Broken Hearts Day festivities kicking off in-game tomorrow. 
The Broken Hearts Day event announcement isn't the biggest news of the day on Pandora. 2K and Gearbox also revealed Borderlands 3 Director's Cut, an expanded edition of the game that includes new story content, which will hopefully redeem Ava, one of the most hated characters in all of the Borderlands franchise. 
Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre is a Headhunter Pack for Borderlands 2. The DLC includes a small story and a boss fight with a unique head and skin to unlock as well as a few secret activities that provide additional loot. The DLC released on February 11th 2014 for a price of $2.99. It was the fourth "Headhunter" pack. The DLC can be accessed by Fast Traveling to Rotgut Distillery where  
Dr. Ned DLC released first, plus don't you think it's better to play Knoxx at a higher level for better loot since it's the biggest DLC? I planned to play Dr. Ned, then Knoxx, then Claptrap since that was their release order (and Moxxi's whenever because it's just a horde style challenge mode and always scales; can be used to level up also). 
Gearbox has announced its final cuts of Borderlands 2 DLC - including a Valentine's Day-themed add-on that will launch next week.. Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre will be available on 11th  
Valentine is an NPC from Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Valentine would tell you he's a dashing rogue with a penchant for danger and a flair for heroism. Others would describe him as "a washed-up low-rent space pirate" or "no longer welcome at this Pancake Castle or any other participating locations" or, most recently, "you're going to crash us into that mountain, knucklehead!"He loves Bunkers

Headhunter Packs are small DLC that were created for Borderlands 2. They are smaller in size than traditional DLC offerings and were sold for a price of $2.99.

With Valentine’s Day soon upon us, Borderlands 2 developer Gearbox has decided to show their loyal vault hunters across all platforms some love in a Valentine’s Day themed add-on, Mad Moxxi And The Wedding Day Massacre. Although themed on a holiday based on love, the DLC is quite the opposite, as per the usual Borderlands twist. 
Each game in the Borderlands series includes several add-on content (aka downloadable content, or DLC for short) packs available. The first two games have a "Game of the Year Edition," which include DLC with the base game, with later games having an "Ultimate Edition," which include all DLC ever </p>
