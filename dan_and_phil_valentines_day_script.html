        <h2><strong>dan and phil valentines day script valentines day delivery gifts for her uk</strong></h2>
        <p>Hi dan happy valentine’s day. 
Hi dan happy valentine’s day. i know you said we’re not doing anything for valentine’s day but you had to go to bed leaving me with 5 hrs with nothing to do. So i have made this video because i love you. and i’ve never had valentine’s day with anyone before. so this is me saying i love you. 
The video was a Valentine’s Day message from Phil to Dan, saying that he loved him, and remembering various events from their time together. Dan commented on the video thanking Phil for it and saying he loved him. 
The "Valentine's Day Video" (also known as "The V-Day Vid" or "The Video That Shall Not Be Named") is an extremely personal video made by Phil for Dan as a Valentine's Day present. Discussing this video is highly discouraged and often met with scorn by the Phandom as most fans agree this to be 
So, the first one is on the snowiest day ever (drawing of the two in the snow), we were walking through the abandoned hospital. And you had your hat on and you lay down on the snow and looked at the stars and I lay next to you and kissed you. Then wrote 'I love Dan' in the snow. 
In the Valentine’s Day video, Phil tells Dan, “ the week we spent together in my house was amazing, I think that’s when I properly fell in love with you. Formspring answer from Dan (likely from the end of December 2009, given the wording of the question) 
Over the years, Dan and Phil have told various stories of how they met. For this post, I’ll just focus on the day they first met in real life, which is what Phil talks about in the Valentine’s Day video. 
In the Valentine’s Day video, when Phil talks about “funny times in my bed", text appears on the screen that says “omg so much cherry everywhere". 
The document analyzes a Valentine's Day video posted by Phil in 2010 that was claimed to be an April Fools prank. The analysis finds evidence across social media from 2009-2010 that matches details in the video, making the prank story unlikely. 
“Valentine’s day is technically over Philly” Dan giggled, pulling the door to as he stepped out of the door in his bare feet. “Tough, these are for you” Phil smiled, taking a step closer to Dan. 
Hi Dan. Happy Valentine’s Day. I know you said we weren’t gonna do anything for Valentine’s Day, but you had to go to bed, leaving me for five hours with nothing to do. So, I have made this video, because I love you, and I’ve never had Valentine’s Day with anyone before. So, this is me saying, “I love you.” 
Dan and Phil’s Valentine’s Day video offerings have become a beloved tradition for their fans, a quirky blend of heartfelt sentiment and their signature brand of playful banter. Analyzing their past efforts reveals a fascinating evolution in both content and production style, offering a valuable case study in online video trends. 
Phil picked him up at the train station, then they went to Starbucks, visited the Apple Store, went on the Manchester Eye and then went to the Skybar. Dan spent the night at Phil’s (Phil’s parents were away on holiday), and on the next day they shot Phil is not on fire. Dan spent a second night at Phil’s house, then went back home on the

Summary: Phil wants to celebrate Valentine’s Day with Dan. Valentine's Day (fanfiction.net) - Not Perfect Only Human Summary: This is just a short one shot . 
A grade-school boy wants flowers for his first true love; two high school seniors plan first-time sex at noon; a TV sports reporter gets the assignment to find romance in LA; a star quarterback contemplates his future; two strangers meet on a plane; grandparents, together for years, face a crisis; and, an "I Hate Valentine's Day" dinner beckons  
I think it's fine to watch it. Dan and Phil have made it clear that they don't want the video publicly posted on YouTube, or tumblr, or whatnot. So as long as you respect that, I think you're good to go. I've seen it. I'd also shared it via dropbox with a few fellow fans. I don't feel guilty about either action. 
onision was talking about how he thought dan was really hot and he told his followers to go to dans live show and tell him to do a video with onision but dan saw it and told us to stop talking about him because he's problematic and onision got mad and tried to say dan and phil were brain washing us and he basically just tried to start shit. he also called phil ugly on multiple occasions 
Happy Valentine's Day, everyone! Remember that you are loved, wanted, and valued more than you know. Reach out to those you love today and make sure they know it, too! </p>
