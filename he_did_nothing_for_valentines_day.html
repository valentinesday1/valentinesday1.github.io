        <h2><strong>he did nothing for valentines day tgif valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>TLDR; he didn’t get me/plan anything for Valentine’s Day. He promises to put more effort in but so did my exes. How do I get past this when all my experiences are telling me it won’t get better? 
I asked him, two to three weeks ago, to plan something for Valentine’s Day. I asked him almost every day if he had planned anything. I had gotten a babysitter for my son then, and was just going to update on time. That’s all. And he never gave me an update because he didn’t plan anything. 
Feeling neglected on Valentine’s Day can really bring you down, but try to avoid letting it affect the rest of your day. If you’re seriously upset, try your best to pretend it's not Valentine's Day at all. Unlike most major holidays, Valentine's Day is relatively easy to ignore. 
Are you left feeling angry and hurt by his lack of recognition, the fact that he (perhaps once again) forgot Valentine ‘ s day, making your question your self-worth and whether he truly loves you? 
I've been seeing this guy for about two months, and we had made plans for tomorrow, but last night he told me his friend reminded him it was valentine's day and that he just doesn't do valentines day or holidays for that matter. 
Solution: Talk about it with him (I will give you the exact opening sentence to get you started with the conversation, no worries). If you didn’t talk about Valentine’s Day in advance and didn’t mention anything, he might have just forgotten. 
Are you left feeling angry and hurt by his lack of recognition, the fact that he (perhaps once again) forgot Valentine’s day, making your question your self-worth and whether he truly loves you? Before you go down that rabbit hole of self-doubt, here are a few things that you can do if your boyfriend forgot Valentine’s Day, things that you  
Author questions if she deserves gestures of affection from her partner who has never gotten her anything for Valentine's Day, leading her to doubt their compatibility and respect for her feelings. 
Maybe not so much about commercialized Valentine’s Day, but they do care about knowing you still love her,” he said. Brothers91 via Getty Images Not participating in Valentine's Day could look intentional or give your partner the feeling that you don’t really care about them, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who works with men. 
Their flower arrangers make a heroic effort, but a delicate bouquet of freshly cut roses is no match for the desperate, grabby hands of people who show up after 5pm on Valentine’s Day. 
I’m in a similar situation my partner of 4 years did absolutely nothing for me yesterday (Valentine’s day) and I made it clear that I was upset and every time that he asked me what was wrong I clearly told him that I was upset that for the second year in a row he did absolutely nothing for Valentine’s Day. He really didn’t care one  
My husband didn’t do anything for Valentine’s Day. &amp;nbsp;We usually exchange cards and presents but he did nothing this year. &amp;nbsp;I even reminded him this morning telling him I have your present I just have to write your card. &amp;nbsp;He came home with nothing, not even a card. &amp;nbsp;What would you do? 
Costs nothing. If we go with the one day he’s gonna be gone theory, maybe she’d like one day he’s gonna be gone and every time Valentine’s Day comes around she remembers how he did this particularly sweet thing for her on that day IN ADDITION TO making her feel loved the other 364 days. 
Ldr said he doesn’t believe in Valentine’s Day and did nothing for my birthday which was recent too I’ve been with this guy since almost 2 years now, he was extra sweet in the beginning and said he’ll spoil me and what not, we’ve had a very rocky relationship but we always come back to each other. 
Not everybody celebrates Valentine’s day - hell I’ve been with my husband for 5+ years and can’t remember the last time we did anything for our anniversary, let alone Valentine’s, but I am/we are totally fine with that, because we let the other know that it doesn’t matter. 
The day was far from intimate, he woke up late, my entire day had already passed, and then we hardly spoke (though we did spend the day on the phone) while he watched a race. We've been together for almost a year, and I remember even on my birthday I was expecting a sweet text, but got nothing :/ 
Valentine’s day – the day where crushes are revealed, love is celebrated, and grocery stores make millions of dollars selling cheap paper cards and tasteless sugar cookies to children. Love it or hate it, the weekend before February 14th is one filled with chocolates, roses, and the color pink. 
I'm currently planning to get my partner nothing (they're not a fan of Valentine's day) but we are planning to cook a nice dinner together Saturday. I might also make something a bit special on Valentine's Day itself, maybe a cake or a batch of cookies as a treat, and I'm probably going to insist we watch something romantic together. 
It could be hard to confine to 1 reason why your boyfriend didn’t get you any gift for Valentine’s. Generally, some reasons why this embarrassing and heartbreaking event happened include: he’s just too busy, your gift might still be in transit, or worse, he doesn’t love you anymore. 
I was a month into dating someone this year. I asked him to have a casual, nothing fancy, no big gifts Valentine’s date. He said V day wasn’t even on his radar but he thought it would be fun. He made dinner, I brought dessert and a very small gift. We laughed and talked, it was light and stayed casual. Definitely glad I asked, we both had fun. </p>
