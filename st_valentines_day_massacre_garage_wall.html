        <h2><strong>st valentines day massacre garage wall valentines day video phan transcript</strong></h2>
        <p>Morbid curiosity made the building unusable for typical business, clearly. So it was demolished in 1967. Four collectors wanted to get their hands on the famous rear wall where the killing happened. The afterlife of that grisly wall is the weirdest part of the legacy of the site of the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. George Patey and His Bricks 
A commercial garage on the north side of Chicago was the setting for the most horrific shooting in Mob history, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. On February 14, 1929, seven members and associates of George “Bugs” Moran’s bootlegging gang were lined up against a wall and shot dead inside the garage at 2122 North Clark Street. 
The Mob Museum owns a large section of the brick wall against which the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre victims stood. In 1967, the wall was torn down, and a Vancouver businessman named George Patey bought the bricks, some of which had divots from bullets fired during the Massacre. 
The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre was the murder of seven members and associates of Chicago's North Side Gang on Saint Valentine's Day 1929.

They were lined up against a wall and shot by four unknown assailants, two of whom were disguised as police

St. Valentine’s Day Massacre Evidence. On the chilly winter morning of February 14, 1929, four men entered SMC Cartage Company garage in Chicago.

The crime that became known as the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre occurred on the morning of February 14, 1929, inside a garage on the north side of Chicago. Seven members of Bugs Moran’s gang were lined up against a wall and shot down with Tommy guns. Two of their assailants were wearing police uniforms. 
The wall was part of the SMG Cartage Company garage, which was demolished in 1967 -- but the bloodstained, bullet-pockmarked 10-foot-long wall was bought at an auction by Canadian businessman George Patey. He reassembled all 400+ bricks into a men's room wall at his Banjo Palace nightclub in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
The bricks of that blood-spattered garage wall are now historical artifacts. But the St. Valentine‘s Day Massacre remains as vivid as ever, the bloodiest chapter in a turbulent time when mobsters like Capone ruled the Windy City and violence was the law of the land. 
How the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre Wall came to the museum is its own unusual tale. Thirty-eight years after the massacre, the wall’s building was finally torn down. Businessman George Patey of Vancouver, British Columbia, bought the numbered bricks—still full of shells and slugs fired during the massacre.
