        <h2><strong>do jewish people observe valentines day valentines day gifts nottingham</strong></h2>
        <p>Thus, the question of whether it’s appropriate for Jews to celebrate Valentine’s Day is reasonable. The answer would seemingly be tied to the true origins of the holiday and the history of the saint for whom it’s named. 
Learn why some Jews choose to celebrate the holiday while others prefer Tu B'Av, a Jewish Day of Love. Find out how this alternative celebration has become a Jewish equivalent to Valentine's Day, complete with flowers, romantic dinners, and proposals. 
Judaism certainly believes in celebrating love – whether that love is between spouses, a caregiver and child, relatives, or good friends. A little-known holiday is Tu B'Av (the fifteenth of Av – which falls in mid to late summer). 
Do Jews Celebrate Valentine's Day? As Jews, we may not be sure whether it's proper for us to join the party. After all, for the longest time the full name of this holiday was “St. Valentine's Day” because of its legendary link with the apocryphal story of one of the earliest Christian saints. 
The amazing Rabbi Mike Uram offers his assessment of whether or not it is problematic for Jews to celebrate Valentine’s Day, so feel free to read his view, or any other that you like. 
Even though Tu B’Av may not be on many people’s Jewish radars, it is still a holiday today. (For example, we do not say the Tachanun prayer, which is omitted on holidays.) So Valentine’s Day? Not for Jews. That’s for ancient Romans, Catholics, and greeting card companies. 
From the fourteenth century the focus of Valentine’s Day was romantic love. The Hebrew for love – ahavah – is one of the first words taught to children in the context of the twice-daily recitation of the Shema which demands the Jew “loves God with all one’s heart, one’s soul and one’s might” (Deuteronomy 6:5) . 
Almost every sector in Jewish Israeli society prefers to celebrate Tu B'av over Valentine's Day. Meaning, both secular and religious Jews celebrate the national “day of love” more than the international one. 
Before one can determine whether the Jewish faith sees sending valentines and giving chocolate on February 14 as a deadly sin, we must first see what Valentine's Day is and from whence it comes. There are several early martyrs called St. Valentine. 
But did you know that Jews in Israel celebrate the holiday of love on a day called Tu B’Av (“the fifteenth of [the summer month of] Av”), whose roots go back to ancient times? To many Jewish people this holiday has become the “Jewish Valentine’s Day” or “Jewish Sadie Hawkins Day.” 
Tu B’Av was almost unnoticed in the Jewish calendar for many centuries but it has been rejuvenated in recent decades, especially in the modern state of Israel. In its modern incarnation it is gradually becoming a Jewish Day of Love, slightly resembling Valentine’s Day in English-speaking countries. 
Although Valentine’s Day no longer has any religious elements outside of its name, it still has undeniably Christian origins and an ongoing association with Christianity; there has even been some discussion of whether Jews should celebrate it. 
How Can Jews Celebrate Valentine’s Day? Falling on the same day as Ash Wednesday, the Christian reality of Valentine’s day is hard to ignore this year – even if it is largely considered a secular celebration in the states. So what are Jews supposed to do? Here are three takes on how Jews can get in on Valentine’s day fun with a Jewish spin. 
Tu B'Av is a day of joy that follows Tisha B'Av by six days and contrasts with the sadness of Tisha B'Av. [9] Tu B'Av does not have many established religious rituals associated with its celebration except that Tachanun is not said—either at mincha the day before or on the day itself—and a bride and groom traditionally do not fast if their  
The saddest period in the Jewish yearly cycle takes place in the summer months. Beginning with the 17th of Tammuz, which marks the breaching of the Temple walls by the Romans in 70 CE, our tradition calls for increasing mourning, climaxing three weeks later on the 9th of Av (Tishah B’Av), when the Temple was destroyed. 
The 9 th of Av (Tisha B’Av), the day of the Hebrew calendar on which the Holy Temple was destroyed, is an appropriate day for placing faith in the Jewish People, who survived the destruction and pogroms and always managed to continue marching forward. 
But instead of being an individual process, it is a mutual, shared experience between two people. Tu B’Av is a great day for weddings, commitment ceremonies, renewal of vows, or proposing. It is a day for enhancing current relationships or defining anew what you are looking for in a partner. 
We were told firmly not to celebrate or appreciate Valentine’s Day because St. Valentine murdered Jews. The vehemence with which we were told that explanation over and over again was outstanding. 
What does Valentine's Day have to do with Judaism? [From the Rib?] Video dating for Orthodox singles? [Tablet] "Love is in the Air": a collection of stories about the first year of marriage. 
Why don't Orthodox Jews observe Valentine’s Day? After all, it’s a day dedicated to love – isn’t that a good thing? To understand the answer, let us first examine the origins of the celebration. A Catholic Holiday? For starters, the full name of the holiday is “Saint Valentine’s Day.” You are probably familiar with St. Patrick’s  </p>
