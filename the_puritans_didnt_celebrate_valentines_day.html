        <h2><strong>the puritans didnt celebrate valentines day can you wear white on valentines day</strong></h2>

In the 17th century, Valentine’s Day faced a brief ban in England, largely due to the Puritans who opposed celebrations of romance and other forms of perceived frivolity. 
From heart-shaped boxes of chocolates, to bouquets of roses and pre-written Hallmark cards, Valentine’s Day today is saturated in commercialism and decadence.

St. Valentine, a name that is synonymous with love and romance across the globe, lived at a time when the Roman Empire was at its zenith. He is often best remembered for the act of marrying couples in secret defiance of the Roman Emperor's bans.
