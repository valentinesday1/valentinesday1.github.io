At first he was unsure but then wanted to do it. I knew it wouldn’t arrive in time for Valentine’s day but I was glad he was on board with the idea. I thought he knew it was important to me. So when he didn’t wish me happy Valentine’s Day I was a bit peeved off but instead of getting angry, I let him know that I wish he did. 
Here are a few reasons why you shouldn’t give up hope for him just yet when he hasn’t texted you back all day. 1. Sometimes no news is good news. If he hasn’t texted you, you can assume that he’s exactly where he was when you last talked. If he was kissing you or telling you how amazing you are, that’s probably what he’s still thinking. 
He left me on read after I tried to find a night he was free. A few days later I followed up asking how his week was, got no reply so deleted his number. Tonight he messaged me apologising for the delay, saying he was away all weekend, and asking how I am. Is the 5 days on read, a red flag or acceptable after a first date? 
He also seemed to sign out everytime I signed in. I liked, watched and commented on some of his posts so I wasn't ignoring him on there. He doesn't celebrate Christmas, I do however he didn't message me or New Year either or Valentines Day. This is when I deactivated everything as I am upset about being ignored. 
Happy Valentine’s Day! Thanks for being my person. To the person who makes me the best version of myself. Happy V-Day to the person who would help me hide a body.
