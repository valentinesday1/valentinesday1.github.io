        <h2><strong>valentines day cards what to write reddit valentines day for kids poems n</strong></h2>
        <p>Writing a Valentine's Day card is a great way to express your feelings of love and admiration for someone special. Depending on the person you are writing to, the length and content of the card may vary. There are no wrong ways to write a Valentine's Day card as long as it comes from your heart. 
The most touching Valentine's Day card I ever received was from now an ex girlfriend. Context, I can be a real piece of shit sometimes and will behave as such until I trust someone enough to let my guard down. She wrote 'You have convinced me that you are in fact a good person'. No frills no mushy language, but that was absolutely the most  
I think a card and a stuffed animal are great. But maybe not the typical bear holding a heart. If you know her favorite animal, get that instead. As for the card, don’t try to be funny or overly unique. Just write something sweet and simple. My day gets brighter every time I see you smile. I will always remember the day I met you and how 
Happy Valentine’s Day! Thanks for being my person. To the person who makes me the best version of myself. Happy V-Day to the person who would help me hide a body.

If You Don't Know What To Write In A Valentine's Day Card, These 60 Heartfelt Sayings Are (Love) Lifesavers You might even catch Cupid's eye By Emily Becker and Aliza Pelto Updated: Feb 02  
I'm thinking of things to write on my girlfriend's flower message card. I want it to be funny - she has got a great sense of humour. My father's version of this gave me the idea when he gave my 48yr old mother a Happy 50th birthday balloon on her 48th and on the flower card wrote "Please stop working the streets, it's upsetting the children". 
I (20 M) have been in a relationship for four months with my girlfriend (19 F). I really enjoy being with her and everything is going great. Tomorrow we’re going to be exchanging gifts and cards. In the card, I’m going to be writing some thoughtful messages about how I feel about her in the card and make it special. 
I'm certain she's doing the same, because if not then she's the kind of person who would have ended it by now. She means more to me than any other person in the world and I love her. I bought her a really romantic Valentine's Day card and I'm at a loss for what to write in it. 
For Example: Reading enthusiasts might like a bookmark, a gift card to buy books/manga, book themed snacks, a Valentine's card with funny/romantic quotes/references from a story they enjoy, or a short story about why you love them/your relationship, jewelry/ stationery/ accessories/ novelty socks / whatever they're into that fits into your budget. 
I am a 25-year-old woman and I love men and I love Valentine’s Day. Here is my advice for you. Get 1 thing that is a traditional romantic gift, and get 1 thing that says something about your girlfriend’s personality. Or, even better, combine the two. For example, if she loves whales, you could get her candy that’s shaped like whales. 
Here we give 142+ heartfelt Valentine's Day messages and quotes so you can write in your cards to share with the special people in your life. If you're at a loss for Valentine's Day gift ideas, check out our personalized Valentine's Day gift selection. 
"I like you every day, so let's show it every day, instead of just excessively showing it one day of the year. Here's to the meaningless celebration of another consumer holiday in the Ponzi scheme known as capitalist America. Happy Valentine's Day." 
Title basically says it all. I’ve been seeing this guy for a few weeks. We’ve had mutual friends and been acquaintances for awhile. It’s going really really well, so i’m just looking for something cute, and funny to write in the card I got him. 
My wife and I have been together for 16 years, with two beautiful girls. I love her with all my heart but I am sick of the abuse. These past two weeks I have been using the gray rock method which yesterday I feel like we were making progress but it all fell to pieces later on in the night. 
Things are progressing nicely, and we've spent a bit of time together with 2 weekend long sleepovers, so I decided to make him Nutella stuffed chocolate chip cookies for Valentine's Day. I bought him a card (something that is more on the funny side and not sappy) but I'm debating if I should give it to him or what I should even write in it. </p>
