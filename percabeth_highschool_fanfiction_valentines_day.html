        <p>"Nah, I'll be fine. I can walk." Percy quickly glanced in the mirror one more time before shrugging into his coat. He saw Paul lighting candles on the dinner table for his parent's Valentine's dinner tonight as he walked towards the door. Paul caught Percy's gaze and winked. "Good luck, Perce." Percy smirked and nodded towards him, opening the  
After he ate he had archery with the Apollo and Athena campers. He walked over to Annabeth and said, "Happy Valentine's Day, wise girl." She smirked and said, "Thanks, seaweed brain. Happy Valentine's Day to you too." They kissed and when they broke apart Percy said, "I have a really special gift for you. 
Valentine's Day was possibly one of Annabeth's least favorite holidays. She found it pointless and stupid and a waste of money. It was even worse this year, with her and her boyfriend being too busy with school to even see each other, especially because their schedules seemed to oppose each other. His breaks were her class times and vice-versa.

Yeah I finally finished!! Sorry I haven't been updating much lately (you must think I like disappeared off the face of the earth) I'm getting lazy, but I'm trying to change or at least make more time for writing. Anyway HAPPY almost VALENTINES DAY! If you're single and sad, I with you, well I'm not really sad, but whatever. Ok I'll shut up now.. 
Read stories about #annabethchase, #annabeth, and #highschool on Wattpad, recommended by Percabeth_books  A Percabeth Fanfic. 44.9K 732 10. One day, Percy Jackson  
This is just a fluffy Valentines Day Percabeth fanfiction. Percy POV. I'm pacing my living room nervously. Why? Well today it February thirteenth and tomorrow is Valentines Day! This is my first Valentines Day I actually have a girlfriend to buy a present for, and I have not the slightest clue what to get her! 
Read the most popular percabeth-high-school stories on Wattpad, the world's largest social storytelling platform. 
percabeth highschool Summary so basically in a punk!percy au, a series of supposedly fun late night and sleep deprived phone calls between annabeth and percy create a wonderful and charming relationship between the two of them 
Requests are allowed! What's not allowed are any gay couples. And I will try to do Percabeth but I'm not a big fan of it so it might not be that good. I will do friends one-shots. Like Jasico, Percico, Pipabeth, etc. BUT ONLY FRIENDS!! 
Annabeth Chase is a no one, spending her time studying, hiding from others, and burying herself deep into her past. To top it all off, this anti-social loner has the biggest crush on Percy Jackson—the most popular guy in school. Travel through the pain of high school with Annabeth as she watches her beloved one, hidden in the shadows  
Follow/Fav Another Percabeth in High School Fanfic. By: Itsafangirlworld.  One day we will find you a girl. A real one, that is." Before I can respond, the volume  
Percabeth High school Chapter 1. Annabeths POV. My name is Annabeth Chase. I have long curly blond hair, tan skin, and grey eyes. I am a half-blood. Only I, my father, and my mother Athena know. Athena is the Goddess of wisdom and battle strategy. My father (Fredrick Chase) and I just moved to New York from California. 
FYI: this story takes place after TLO, the lost hero never happened. This is a few months latter, school is starting, just fyi! PERCABETH 4 LIFE. Percy POV: Honestly the day started like any other, I got up, ate, took a shower, got dressed and went to school. It seemed like a normal day, but it wasn't. Today was my first day in 11th grade. WOW! 
After he ate he had archery with the Apollo and Athena campers. He walked over to Annabeth and said, "Happy Valentine's Day, wise girl." She smirked and said, "Thanks, seaweed brain. Happy Valentine's Day to you too." They kissed and when they broke apart Percy said, "I have a really special gift for you. 
Annabeth's pov: My goodness. This school is HUGE! It was the middle of the school year (about) and my friend, Justin, insisted on coming with me to the new school. 
Nobody's around when Valentine's day actually comes, and even if no one actually sits together at the Fireworks everybody still asks each other out." Well. "So it's not really that romantic?" I asked hopefully. "Eh, it could be. I guess it would be a pretty nice place to, like, make out if you were feeling really turned on by your partner" 
I'm so excited, since this is Annabeth and I's first Valentine's Day together, since I had been missing during the last one. I spent the entire week obsessing over what to get her, where to meet her, what kind of flowers to get her, if she would even want flowers 
Annabeth POV. Valentine's Day. Today's the day! I wonder if Percy will do it at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Most likely breakfast, so that he can get it over with. 
Percy and Annabeth go on a school residential trip first, then some high school and day-to-day life. basically just Percabeth fluff, but some unimportant drama (Not relationship drama, or anything actually of consequence, don't worry). Disclaimer: I do not own PJO </p>
