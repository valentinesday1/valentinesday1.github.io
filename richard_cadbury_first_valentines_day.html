        <h2><strong>richard cadbury first valentines day what is a good valentines day gift for my husband</strong></h2>
        <p>The first mention of St. Valentine’s Day as a romantic holiday appeared in the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer in 1382.  Into this love-crazed fray came Richard Cadbury, scion of a British  
Valentine's Day has been linked with romance since at least the 14th century. But somehow it took another 500 years or so for chocolate to enter the picture. Its appearance was suitably sentimental and spectacular, however, thanks to Richard Cadbury, whose family had been making chocolate in England since 1824. 
Richard Cadbury (UK), the eldest son of John Cadbury, founder of the world famous company, created the first known heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine’s Day 1868. He was a pioneer in chocolate box design and often used his own paintings to make the lids of the boxes more appealing. 
Somewhere along the way, Valentine's Day and chocolate merged together, all thanks to perhaps the most popular man in chocolate's illustrious history: Richard Cadbury. The confectioner giant not only marked the beginning of what would be a lifelong association of chocolate with the love-filled day, but also gave the world its first heart-shaped  
It wasn't until 1962 that Hershey Kisses were first wrapped in red and green foil to celebrate Christmas. Today, to celebrate Valentine's Day, kisses are wrapped in red foil. Heart-Shaped Boxes of Chocolates: Richard Cadbury, son of Cadbury founder John Cadbury, created 'fancy' boxes of chocolates to increase sales. He used drawings of his  
Surprise! The heart-shaped box wasn’t invented by a swooning lover. Actually, it was a really smart marketing idea. Our industry knows just how well paperboard packaging can help to sell products, and so did Richard Cadbury, of the famed chocolate company, who created the first Valentine’s Day heart box. Rewind to mid-nineteenth century  
Capitalizing on this newly commercialized holiday, Richard Cadbury, of Cadbury Chocolates, invented the heart-shaped chocolate box in 1868. Though this invention proved to be revolutionary, Cadbury did not file an actual patent for his invention, so the heart-shaped chocolate box became widely popular. 
In England, the Cadbury family were not only famous for selling tea, coffee and drinking chocolates; they also gained prominence and wealth throughout the 1800s with their chocolate innovations. Richard Cadbury and his brother George Cadbury took over the business in 1861, and they were on a mission to improve upon the drinking chocolate recipe. 
While elaborately decorated boxes of chocolates had existed for at least a century, it was a sentimental Englishman who first connected them to Valentine’s Day. Richard Cadbury (yes, that Cadbury), chocolate-maker, philanthropist, and (I’m going to go ahead and assume) hopeless romantic, is credited with inventing and marketing the first  
In the 1860s, at the height of the Victorian-era Valentine’s Day craze, Richard Cadbury sold his family’s small, sweet morsels in elaborately decorated boxes. Emptied containers were used to  
The origin of Valentine’s Day is attributed to various early Christian martyrs named Valentine, but it’s linkage to romantic love seems to appear first in Chaucer’s 1382 poem, Parlement of  
Who invented the first Valentine's Day candy box? Richard Cadbury, of the Cadbury chocolate company. How much do Americans spend on chocolate for Valentine’s Day each year? $1 billion. How many NECCO sweetheart conversation candies are sold around Valentine’s Day each year? 8 billion. How did NECCO candies become so popular? 
Richard was the first to commercialise the connection between romance and confectionery with the company producing a heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine's Day in 1868. [1] In 1878 they acquired 14 acres (57,000 m 2) of land in open country, four miles (6 km) south of Birmingham where they opened a new factory in 1879.

Richard Cadbury, eldest son of John Cadbury who founded the now iconic brand, was the first chocolate-maker to commercialize the association between confectionery and romance, producing a heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine's Day in 1868 
Chocolate Tradition: In 1861, Richard Cadbury created the first heart-shaped chocolate box, a Valentine’s Day tradition that continues with over 36 million boxes sold each year. Economic Impact : Americans spend nearly $26 billion annually on Valentine’s Day gifts, with an average spend of $193 per person. 
Capitalizing on this newly commercialized holiday, Richard Cadbury, of Cadbury Chocolates, invented the heart-shaped chocolate box in 1868. Though this invention proved to be revolutionary  
According to Hallmark cards, a whopping 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are exchanged every February 14 (and that’s not even including all those kids’ Valentines exchanged in classrooms!). 
The person who invented the first Valentine’s Day candy box was Richard Cadbury from the UK. He was one of the founders of the famous Cadbury chocolate brand. Back in the mid-19th century, Richard saw a chance to combine chocolate and romance. </p>
