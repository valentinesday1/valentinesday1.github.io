        <h2><strong>my girlfriend didnt get me anything for valentines day brotines day not valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
My girlfriend didn’t get me anything for valentines Some quick context my gf (19f) and I (19f) have been together for a couple months and today is obviously valentines. I met up with her a couple days ago cause I knew she would be busy today, so I could give her her gifts. 
I’m genuinely upset that my girlfriend didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day This was our first Valentine’s Day together and her first Valentine’s Day with a partner. She (24F) kept saying that she was so excited to have a valentine and to be a valentine, so I (25F) wanted to be sure that I spoiled her and exceed her expectations. 
At the end of the day, what truly matters is the connection and love you share with your partner. Valentine's Day is just one day on the calendar, and a gift, or the lack thereof, shouldn't define your relationship. The most valuable thing is the time and effort you both invest in maintaining a strong and loving bond. 
Valentine's day is generally accepted to be a day to treat your wife/girlfriend well. My wife has literally NEVER got me anything for valentines day in the 17 years we've been together. I go all out for her though, every year. She knocks it out of the park on my bday, wedding anniversary, father's day, religious holidays. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years now, and to this date he's never gotten anything for me on Valentine's Day. I did give him a hint about 2 months ago and said I'd love something for Valentine's Day but he hasn't even sent me a "Happy Valentine's Day" text. He's working away at the moment, and I can't help but feel a little  
I am in a relationship with a guy I love. He is good to me and sometimes I think ‘yes, this is the one for me’ but other times I am not so sure. For example we have been going out for 5 years (we are both 26) and he has never got me anything for Valentines day. We have had rows over this. 
Q: Your partner does sweet and thoughtful things for you throughout the year but doesn’t plan anything special for Valentine’s Day. You’re upset. 
“Just confessed to my husband that I actually do care about Valentine’s Day and I’ve been running a pick-me long con for 16 years pretending I was super chill and didn’t care,” she wrote. In a follow-up essay on her blog , the author explained that this conversation wasn’t some big, drawn-out argument, but more of a “mild chuckle  
Valetines day I made a discord bot that would send her reasons I love her every day for 3 months. She got me nothing for any of those events. She did get me something for my birthday before we started dating and she drew me something for Christmas (so did I). How do I tell her that I'm kinda upset she didnt get me anything without sounding too  
My girlfriend didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day So we are in a long distance relationship because we attend different universities, but Valentine’s Day came around and I sent her a nice little care package with a card and some other things. 
My (24M) girlfriend (26F) didnt get me anything for valentines day I have been seeing this girl for 6 months, official for only about a month. She is tight on cash right now, but is about to be in a better financial position, I don't mind though so I help with groceries, dog food and other odds and ends. 
First off, take a deep breath and don't jump to conclusions. It's easy to feel a bit bummed or even overlooked if you were expecting a little something and it didn't happen, especially on a day like Valentine's Day, which is all about expressing affection. 
That's your own damn fault. It's just a day. Not even your anniversary. Me and my gf didn't even bring up that it's Valentines day. anything I said just sounded selfish when I put it into words. Not selfish, but childish.

I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
I had gotten a babysitter for my son then, and was just going to update on time. That’s all. And he never gave me an update because he didn’t plan anything. We were going to celebrate Valentine’s Day tomorrow evening. I asked if he updated what time he planned something so I could update the babysitter. He said he didn’t plan anything. 
I didn't get anything for Valentine's day either but that's because my husband is deployed with no access to internet or a phone. My cat sure remembered though. Not to sound crazy but we had an awesome salmon dinner and now she's passed out on my tummy. Maybe you could go valentine dinner it up with a friend or parent. 
My point is, most men generally only do anything on Valentine’s Day for one of two reasons: 1) they don’t feel like getting b1tched at for ‘not caring,’ or 2) they think they’ll get laid  </p>
