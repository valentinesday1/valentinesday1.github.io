        <h2><strong>waiting to get nothing for valentines day valentines day meals norfolk</strong></h2>
        <p>I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
I asked him almost every day if he had planned anything. I had gotten a babysitter for my son then, and was just going to update on time. That’s all. And he never gave me an update because he didn’t plan anything. We were going to celebrate Valentine’s Day tomorrow evening.

At the end of the day, what truly matters is the connection and love you share with your partner. Valentine's Day is just one day on the calendar, and a gift, or the lack thereof, shouldn't define your relationship. The most valuable thing is the time and effort you both invest in maintaining a strong and loving bond. 
If your new partner doesn’t want to do something special for Valentine’s Day and you do, this suggests he’s just not that into you, or may signal important information about clashing values. Valentine’s Day, like many holidays, often tap into traditions and messages you’ve internalized since early childhood. 
Remember: There’s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to do Valentine’s Day with your crush, but you deserve clarity and the kind of V-Day where there is no confusion or hesitation. 
S t. Valentine was martyred in ancient Rome in 273 A.D. Since then, the traditions that spring out of his farewell letter — signed “from your Valentine” — have made many other people feel like martyrs, too, to the pressure of making the perfect romantic gesture or showing the purest love. 
For Mr. Derry, a marketing manager and music curator in Brooklyn, Valentine’s Day is about “creating time to be with people I love, and it can be agnostic to romance. It can be platonic. It  
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
Whether the guy is 'supposed to' get his girlfriend anything on Valentine's day is not universally practiced. Likewise on whether or not the girl should get her boyfriend something, though I honestly don't see why not. If girls will expect a Valentine's day gift as well as demand gender equality, it's only fair that the gift-giving goes both ways. 
Remember: There’s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to do Valentine’s Day with your crush, but you deserve clarity and the kind of V-Day where there is no confusion or hesitation. 
I can’t wait to be your wife, Happy Valentine’s Day! I can’t wait for the day I can call you 'my husband' Every time I’m with you, the room gets a whole lot hotter. After we say I do, every day will be like Valentine's Day. You’re sweet, strong, smart and sexy. I’m so glad you’re mine! You’re my dream come true. 
I'm all for the idea of making Valentine's Day a different day than Feb. 14 though, since on just that specific day, flowers and restaurant prices get jacked up ridiculously, but it would probably be better to give her a heads up that you still intend to have plans. 
right. you may not find valentines day big but the other person does. your with someone.. like together and man at a point eventually you both have discussed likes and dislikes? atleast he should have the audacity to discuss valentines day a day or week before with her. then he would have known. but sure in some sense you're right. he isn't  
I never got it, never got something to my girlfriend on valentines day cause it's just every other day, except society expect you to spend money for your S/O without any logical reason. Sounds like he did say yes in the first place because he didn't want to hurt you, but maybe he's like me, he don't see why you expect more on the 14th february

The only wrong decision is when you do nothing and wait for him to figure out your thoughts on Valentine’s Day by himself. If you choose it, then be ready for disappointment, and it will be your responsibility too. 
Fast-forward to February 2023, I had been hinting to him that I would be happy with just flowers this year since he would be traveling during Valentines Day. He always laughed it off and I told him I was serious. I had a gross feeling in the pit of my stomach in the days leading up to Valentine’s Day, thinking that I wouldn’t get anything. 
I’m excited to spend a romantic Valentine’s Day with you. You’re the best, and I appreciate everything you do for me. You’re the French to my toast. It’s been a journeyone I’d do all over again. I didn’t know love before I met you, and I can’t wait to share Valentine’s Day with you. You’re my hero in so many ways. </p>
