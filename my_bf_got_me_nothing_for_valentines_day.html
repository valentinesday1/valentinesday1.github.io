        <h2><strong>my bf got me nothing for valentines day valentines day stripclub</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
Coincidentally, I had also received flowers from my ex that Valentine’s day apologizing for never treating me right and telling me he still loved me. A year later, I got nothing. He came over after I got stuck at work late and we were gonna order Chipotle. 
I (f22) have been dating my boyfriend (m24) for two years. We've celebrated valentines day before by gifting eachother cutesie things but yesterday I received nothing. I don't really care about money being spent on me, he could've written me a letter or gifted me a cute rock for all I care. 
Reasons You Got Nothing For Valentine’s Day With Your Boyfriend Some Men Don’t Know. I’m truly sorry to serve you the news when you don’t want to believe in them. Some men seriously underestimate the importance of Valentine’s Day for women. They don’t know how much a flower would mean to us on that day. 
Your boyfriend forgot Valentine ‘ s Day and it has left you feeling angry and bereft. I totally get it. One year my boyfriend (now ex-husband) forgot about Valentine ‘ s Day and got me some on-sale roses the next day. It felt shitty, to say the least. 
I’m not sure if I’m taking this too deep but I got my boyfriend of 8 months a couple of things for Valentine’s Day, some chocolate, a necklace and made him a card. I used the last of my money this week for all that and gave it too him as soon as I saw him. He didn’t give me anything in return and just said thank you. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
Still, he got you nothing in return. If your boyfriend has seriously dropped the ball on Valentine’s, it is okay to let him know. Just remember, it is always best to try and keep the conversation calm. Let him know that you are hurt that you expressed your desire to celebrate Valentine’s Day with gifts and he didn’t follow through.

I am in a relationship with a guy I love. He is good to me and sometimes I think ‘yes, this is the one for me’ but other times I am not so sure. For example we have been going out for 5 years (we are both 26) and he has never got me anything for Valentines day. We have had rows over this. 
I haven't got my GF anything for the three valentines we've been together and she hasn't done anything for me either. Valentine day is a pointless day in the first place. You don't need a special day to let your SO know you care about them. 
valentine's day is one of the dumbest holidays. i was never a fan of giving or receiving gifts and the like in general, so i wouldn't do anything for my partner and i wouldn't want him to do anything for me and i would refuse any gift unless he absolutely insisted on giving me one and was totally fine with not getting anything back. i do the  
This describes me and my partner. We will have anniversary soon and for entire year I have been saying: "you plan valentines day and I'll make nice anniversary" I have mentioned day before if he could plan something. We had argument today and he have accused me of making him read my mind. He could have told me if he didn't know what to do. 
My bf didnt get me anything on valentine's day.i got him a shirt and book but he didnt even bother to get me a single rose.he did say that he is ignorant when it comes to these things and that  
Some quick context my gf (19f) and I (19f) have been together for a couple months and today is obviously valentines. I met up with her a couple days 
The day was far from intimate, he woke up late, my entire day had already passed, and then we hardly spoke (though we did spend the day on the phone) while he watched a race. We've been together for almost a year, and I remember even on my birthday I was expecting a sweet text, but got nothing :/ 
Valetines day I made a discord bot that would send her reasons I love her every day for 3 months. She got me nothing for any of those events. She did get me something for my birthday before we started dating and she drew me something for Christmas (so did I). How do I tell her that I'm kinda upset she didnt get me anything without sounding too  
One year my boyfriend (now ex-husband) forgot about Valentine’s Day and got me some on-sale roses the next day. It felt shitty, to say the least. But that didn’t mean he didn’t care about me – he just was working hard and missed the day. 
He was away for job training. On his birthday, he got some small gifts, a nice meal, and a show he’d been wanting to go to. Christmas was a card and some clothes. Valentine’s Day, I SNAIL MAILED him a V-day card. Other wives of husbands in the same class posted their chocolates/flowers. I got a “happy birthday/v-day” text and that’s it. 
I've been seeing my BF for almost 3 years now. I got a "Oh shit, did you know its valentines day" in the morning while I was brushing my teeth. I said yep, and he said "Happy Valentines day" and I said it back. Honestly, I know hes bad at v day and I don't really care. </p>
