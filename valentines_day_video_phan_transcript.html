If the video is real, it means Dan and Phil dated at the end of 2009/beginning of 2010. They probably dated for longer than that, and they may still be together, but the blog will mostly touch on the period between October 2009 and February 2010, from the time they met until the Valentine’s Day video was made. 
This article is a transcript of the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Valentine's Day" from season 1, which aired on February 14, 2000.

Introduction. I’ve created this blog to add context to the Valentine’s Day video that Phil made a few years back, and analyze its content. When you gather together all the tweets, Formspring answers, Dailybooth posts and YouTube videos that relate to events mentioned in the Valentine’s Day video, you start to see a narrative appear
