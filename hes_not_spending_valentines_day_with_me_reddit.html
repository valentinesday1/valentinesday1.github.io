        <h2><strong>hes not spending valentines day with me reddit little america valentines day brunch</strong></h2>
        <p>The only thing is the stuff I've seen about a guy missing Valentine's day with his girlfriend is a red flag, and I realized it was kinda off that he forgot and planned a day out where he couldn't text me specifically on Valentine's and leading into the next day where he might not be home either 
I am the opposite. I LOVE finding that perfect card for my boyfriend that says everything I feel. Sometimes it is hard to put your love for someone into words other than "I love you." His birthday, our anniversary, and Valentine's day I usually spend forever reading cards until I find him just the right one. And he keeps them all :) 
This describes me and my partner. We will have anniversary soon and for entire year I have been saying: "you plan valentines day and I'll make nice anniversary" I have mentioned day before if he could plan something. We had argument today and he have accused me of making him read my mind. He could have told me if he didn't know what to do. 
Hi there, happy Valentines day to you all. I've been dating this guy for 3 months now so it's a fairly new relationship. Quick background story 
I dont like to assume, but I dont think he prioritizes you as he should. He had the option to hangout with his friends ANY OTHER DAY OF THE YEAR but he decided to hangout on valentines day. He chose to hangout with them over you knowing that it was meant to be your guysâ€™s day. And when he said he now hates the holiday because of you- bad sign. 
Valentineâ€™s Day is a day to spend with your partner, and unless you disclaim from the very beginning that you will not spend VDay with your girlfriend it is unfair to expect women to accept that. There are many other days you can do something special with your teenager that you see way more than your partner. 
Today we were video chatting and he tells me that his ex is inviting him to go on a picnic with him ON Valentine's Day. At first I was a little iffy, but at least he was asking me for permission. I gave him the ok because I know his ex and we're decent friends, and he said it was just a picnic. 
I'm 28 he's 33 â€“ I'm a little confused because I have been spending a lot of time with this guy I met on a dating app late last year. It *seems* like he is really interested in me. He wants to be together all the time and we have a lot in common have chemistry. Anyway, I have not heard from him today and we have no plans. 
Im 21 and im not upset about how my boyfriend wants to snowboard instead of spending valentines with me. weekends are his day off And he works (12 hours) a day. 5 days a week. I think you should be more understanding imo. If he makes you feel loved everyday anyways, whatâ€™s the problem? Or maybe he doesnâ€™t? Think about it. 
So Valentine's Day is coming up and even though we have only been talking for a month, I figured having a couple drinks together or doing something cute would be a great way to spend the day together. He tells me he doesn't "Celebrate Valentine's Day" because the year before (2020) on Valentine's Day his ex fiance left him. 
I'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. And please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. That was my decision, not yours. 
He is unbothered by all this and still wants to go see the gig with her. Now I don't really mind him spending time with his ex- I trust him. But it's Feb 14th - he told me this and I immediately said, 'so you are spending valentines with your ex?' He had genuinely forgotten about valentines and apologised but said this gig was important to him. 
He was completely clueless that I felt a way and said heâ€™s never celebrated Valentineâ€™s Day before as heâ€™s never been in a relationship at the timeframe of the month ðŸ¥µ we are grown &amp; I feel one still makes effort. So, now reconnected plans a trip at that time and Iâ€™m not invited. We also had issues before with him allowing me to  
On Valentineâ€™s Day he called me and said get ready he was taking me out to surprise me i honestly was needing a break out and I was glad we werenâ€™t fighting anymore While I was getting ready my sister entered the room and had a breakdown which ended in a panic attack, she was still crying in my arms when my husband entered our room dressed  
In my opinion, Valentineâ€™s Day shouldnâ€™t be about spending money on actually gift gifts but as a way to show your love for each other. That being said, if youâ€™d prefer spending some money on an actual gift, I would do something like a couples massage or a boudoir photo shoot or something like that. 
Okay, so I really want to spend Valentineâ€™s Day with my girlfriend (of about 4 months) but she decided that she was going to accept plans with her two friends (male and female) instead of hanging out with me because the female friend didnâ€™t want to be alone on Valentineâ€™s day. Which of course, leaves me alone. 
Iâ€™ve spent every single valentineâ€™s day alone for 29 years, just chill out and work on yourself. I am now 30 and have met someone amazing and this year will be my first valentineâ€™s day not alone. Whether it be sooner or later, waiting for the right match is absolutely worth it. Take it from someone who was single all his life until this year 
My gf (21F) and I (22M) have been together for almost 4 years now and everything has been great. Next Friday is Valentine's Day but Fridays have always been my game night with my buddies and my gf is well aware of it. She got really upset when I told her I want to play with my boys on Valentine's Day and even asked her to reschedule our V-Day date. 
Maybe both things are possibleâ€” maybe he did love me, a lot, but not enough to want to stay. Either way, I can't blame him for moving on; he's not doing anything wrong by simply not feeling the same about me. Not doing anything wrong by pursuing happiness, by creating his ideal life. </p>
