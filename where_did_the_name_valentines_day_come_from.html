        <p>In this article, we take a look at the various historical and cultural influences that have shaped Valentine’s Day. From the mysterious figure of Saint Valentine and the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia to the medieval traditions of courtly love and the commercialization of the holiday in the modern era, we explore how February 14th became the day to celebrate love.

Valentine’s Day, holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. Given their similarities, it has been suggested that the holiday has origins in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, held in mid-February. 
It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine, and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in many regions of the world. [3][4] 
Pope declared Feb. 14 as Valentine's Day in 5th Century Pope Gelasius declared Feb. 14 as St. Valentine’s Day in 496 AD. It was not until much later, however, that the day became definitively  
St. Valentine, a name that is synonymous with love and romance across the globe, lived at a time when the Roman Empire was at its zenith. He is often best remembered for the act of marrying couples in secret defiance of the Roman Emperor's bans. 
Where Did Valentine’s Day Come From? The beginning was, as for most of us, totally erotic  Young men and women were expected to emulate the life of the saint whose name was on the billet they  
The World Book Encyclopedia tells us regarding Valentine’s Day: “The customs connected with the day . . . probably come from an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia which took place every February 15.

The best thing about this celebration is that it's not quite the anti-Valentine's Day (no bitter tears here), it's a happy holiday all about appreciating females and friendships. That is why it falls the day before February 14th - because boys come and go, but friends are forever.
