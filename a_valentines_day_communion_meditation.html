        <h2><strong>a valentines day communion meditation valentines day flowers new relationship</strong></h2>
        <p>A Scripture Meditation. Since many people don’t have the ideal picture of a father’s love because of how their earthly fathers treated them, we want to pray into the truth of our heavenly Father’s extraordinary love for us. His love is strong and certain and safe. It is faithful and formidable and forever. It is, in fact, perfect in every  
• Sometimes we celebrate a person, rather than an event. Memorial Day is for veterans; La-bor Day for workers; Valentine’s Day for lovers -- and St. Patrick’s day for anyone who can recognize the color “green.” • Nobody celebrates with a diet. The diet starts January 2nd, not New Year’s Day. Food and 
Everywhere I look near Valentine's Day, there's chocolate: boxes of chocolate in all the stores, chocolate on tv promising to be the only love you need, chocolate girl scout cookies--CHOCOLATE! I even saw chocolate Altoid breath mints in the grocery checkout aisle the other day! 
Dan Robinson delivers a special "Valentine's Day" Communion Meditation. No matter what your relationship status is there is a love that is greater than any  
This meditation was originally written to be shared at a dinner hosted by my pastor and his wife and daughters on Valentine’s Day. They invited a few single people from the church over to celebrate to the love we share together. While I think even my congregation might do more for single people - and especially those who are older and single (I write as just a 24 year old); but my experience  
Perhaps this Valentine's Day we can think of not only the ones that love us here, but also of the Father in heaven that has a very big heart for us. He cares, wants us to be healed, cleansed from our sins, in right relationship with Him and others around us, and on our way to heaven. 
Communion 2022. Communion 2023. Communion 2024 . For those who would like a paper copy of the first seven volumes of communion meditations (in one volume) it's available (at our cost, no profit) here. The material is exactly the same as in the PDF download. Communion Meditations for Holidays. New Year's Day. President's Day. Valentine's Day 
The day that most people pretend to hate because they either don’t feel loved, or don’t want to show love, but mostly because they always wish the love they had was more intense, more real. So, it’s the day that we eat candy and have nice dinners and buy flowers and try to imagine a love that is so powerful that romance bursts out of us  
You know the routine. It’s Valentine’s Day, that special holiday set aside to celebrate love and romance. But you’re single. You don’t have a girlfriend, a date, or even a female friend willing to be seen in public with you. So you invite over a few buddies to watch Braveheart, play Halo, and talk about how you don’t understand girls. 
In years past, when I have written communion meditations in February, I tend to gravitate toward love. I am sure it is from the reminder of Valentine's Day this month. The topic of love is everywhere. It's on the television screen, it is on people's minds, it's even on the shelves at the store—especially this time of year.

Thanks to the commercialism surrounding Valentine's Day, many people feel unloved on the one day of the year set aside to celebrate love A post shared by Waylon Lewis &amp; Friends (@walkthetalkshow) on Jan 29, 2017 at 7:01am PST Love is available to all of us, whether or not we happen to be in a romantic relationship right now. Yet 
You’re forming relationships that will carry into eternity, in fellowship with one another and the Godhead forever. What joy is there to be found in the communion of the saints! Christian single, you are far from being alone. So be honest with yourself, your friends, and, most of all, with the Lord about how you’re feeling this Valentine  
So, on Valentine’s Day, if we want love, we have to raise our sights to him. We wouldn’t go to someone who has water and expect for them to be the satisfying reality of water. We must go to the water itself for that. 
Now and always, let us keep on giving thanks that we are loved by Godand let’s enjoy that love Day by Day, our Lord’s Supper song.. LORD’S SUPPER SONG. DAY BY DAY. Godspell . MUSIC BREAK. THE LOVE OF GOD. Mercy Me . TODAY’S BIBLE LESSON. The Lord’s Supper: Valentine’s Day and Every Day, You are Loved 
I encourage you to enter into the mercy of God and allow Him to work in your life as you adore and love Him. His Holy Spirit will transform you into His likeness, day by day. Praise God! Everything that you do must flow from your heart’s desire for God and because of your love for Him. Everything else becomes a religious activity. 
In honor of the noble martyr Valentine, whose day we celebrate today, I would like to propose a meditation on Ephesians 5: 22-33. In this text we learn that a husband plays the role of Christ and

Valentine's Day is coming up quickly, and perhaps you're beginning to feel your heart a-flutterin'. Whether it's fluttering due to being love struck, anxious, or just over-hyped on candy, I'm not  </p>
