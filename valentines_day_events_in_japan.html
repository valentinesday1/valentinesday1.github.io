        <h2><strong>valentines day events in japan college gifts for valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day in Japan is celebrated uniquely compared to Western countries. With the majority of men receiving chocolates on Valentine's Day and reciprocating the gesture one month later on White Day by giving gifts to women, the romantic event is divided into two different occasions. 
Japan also observes a unique reciprocal holiday on March 14th, known as White Day, where men return the favour to those who gifted them chocolates on Valentine’s Day. This was created by the confectionery industry in the late 1970s and has since become a firmly established part of our Valentine’s Day cycle. 
Valentine’s Day was not really celebrated in Japan until the 1950s when it became a trend for high school girls to take February 14th as an opportunity to confess their feelings to their crush. An offering of chocolate treats, either store bought or homemade, would have been the most cost effective option for a student. 
Valentine’s Day in Japan has a unique history and customs that many foreigners find interesting. According to the Japan Chocolate &amp; Cocoa Association, this custom started in the 1950s. A chocolate company put up a handwritten “Valentine’s Sale” sign at Isetan department store in Shinjuku.

Valentine’s Day in Japan is a day when romance, tradition, and sweet gestures come together. On this special day, you can find signs of love and warm affection everywhere, from mythology and natural symbols to unique gifts embodying Japanese culture's essence. These practices make Valentine's Day a fantastic celebration of love in all its forms! 
There are several theories over the origin of Valentine’s Day in Japan, but it is widely believed to have arrived in Japan in the 1930’s. Morozoff, a famous Japanese confectionery company , started as a small chocolate shop in 1931 when it began a marketing campaign to encourage people to buy and send chocolates to loved ones on February 14th. 
Therefore, you can easily find limited-time speciality chocolates when visiting chocolate shops during the time near Valentine's Day and White Day when love is in the air! Chocolate-themed events galore throughout the country! From the beginning of the new year to 14 th February, Japan dives headfirst into the Valentine’s Day atmosphere  
On February 14, women give chocolates to men they admire, and on March 14, known as White Day, men return the favour. However, before you embark on your own romantic adventure, let us explore Valentine’s Day in Japan together. History of Valentine’s Day in Japan 
Men/people who received chocolate on Valentine’s Day are expected to return the favor by gifting chocolate to women/Valentine’s Day chocolate givers. White Day was not really a thing in Japan until the 1980s, and the color white is thought to be associated with purity, especially when it comes to innocent teenage love in Japanese culture. 
The Japanese practice of women gifting sweets to men on Feb 14 can be traced to a specific event held in February 1958, when Mary Chocolate Co Ltd organized a special sales campaign at a department store in Shinjuku, Tokyo. As the practice took root in Japan over the ensuing decades, the market size continued swell, reaching an estimated 126 billion yen in 2019 before

Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and it's a day where many of us want to do something special with our significant other to celebrate. If you're looking for some ideas on how to spend Valentine's Day in Tokyo –or not too far afield– this guide has five suggestions. 
In most places celebrating Valentine’s Day, women can expect chocolates, flowers and a romantic dinner from their partner. However, in Japan, it’s the opposite: women give chocolates to the men in their lives—from their boyfriends to their coworkers—although not all chocolates are equal. The special men in their lives receive honmei choco, “true feeling” chocolates, while 
The holiday gained popularity in Japan around 1958, but it was in the late 1970s that Valentine’s Day became a part of Japanese society. The “Japanese-style Valentine’s Day” also emerged, where women express affection by giving chocolates to men. 
Tokyo’s LOVE sculpture is in Nishi-Shinjuku, next to Shinjuku i-Land! Japan’s unique Valentine’s Day traditions have found interest overseas via anime and manga series featuring homemade chocolates and White Day celebrations, but a good old-fashioned Valentine’s Day date is at the heart of this romantic holiday even in Japan. 
Valentine’s Day is a meaningful time to cherish love, and each location in Japan offers a unique way to create beautiful memories. Whether it’s the fairytale atmosphere of Tokyo DisneySea, the peaceful charm of Inokashira Park, or the sparkling night views of Minato Mirai, there’s an excellent destination for every couple. 
Shops in Japan are really on top of their holiday displays. As soon as the clocks strike 9:30 p.m. on Dec. 25, the Christmas trees turn into New Year’s decorations. These then change to oni (demon) masks faster than you can say mamemaki (bean throwing) for Setsubun. If you regularly shop in places like Loft or Tokyu </p>
