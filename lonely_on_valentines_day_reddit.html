        <p>This is the first Valentine's Day in 4 years where I've got someone (they're amazing!) to spend it with. We just met by chance and I am so grateful! She is very supportive and tells me all the time that she's amazed I spent so much time single. Moral of the story is: there are people out there who would think you're the best thing since sliced

People here is not gonna like what i am about to say but, whats the deal with Valentine's day?. Yesterday i went to the market and i saw merchants in every corner selling overprices plushies (300 up to 800 mexican pesos or 15 ~ 40 dlls), natural flowers, or candies all of the overpriced as well, its the same with each and every holiday, not only V-day. 
But I saw her and smiled and she did a "polite" smile back and walked away. I asked her about her working valentines day and what she was doing or did on valentines day. But she kept dodging the question and gave me vague responses like, "Oh you knowwww, just hanging out with friends." 
Valentine's Day used to make me feel like shit when I was 14/15/16 years old, I had such low self-confidence that when I did get a Valentine's Day card or someone asked me out I 100% thought in my head it was a joke or wind-up. 
Lived in the Midwest for a while and they had Sweetest Day in the fall in addition to Valentines Day so the made up holiday thing happened twice per year so you basically could feel special twice a year or feel left out twice a year or roll your eyes twice per year over it .

40 votes, 26 comments. true. Don't be Suicidal. Think of it as a NORMAL DAY. This day shouldn't matter to us, Try your best to ignore it and distract yourself, Me personally I'd just order my favorite meal, Ice cream and watch some stupid trash Reality show. 
I treat valentine's day similar to grade school. It's less about romantic love and just love in general. I basically wish people a happy Valentine's day to tell them, I see them and I care about them. I also enjoy the chocolate and lil treats and just making valentine's, so I made a point to make give one to each person in my work department. 
Cool. That's probably the most common thing cuz most people break up right before good events like Christmas, New Year's Day and Valentine's Day, from personal experience. So relax, this isn't uncommon at all and don't feel bad due to the few Lucky ones that get it. Not everyone has to make use of luck. </p>
