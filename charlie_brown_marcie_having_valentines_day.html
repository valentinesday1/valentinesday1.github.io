The highly renowned and widely acclaimed comic strip known as Peanuts, created by the esteemed Charles M. Schulz, and also referred to as the Charlie Brown comic strip, is a syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip that commenced on October 2, 1950, and eventually culminated on February 13, 2000, a mere solitary day after Schulz's death. 
The special mostly focuses on Charlie Brown and his ongoing failure to get anywhere with the Little Red-Haired Girl. His efforts are complicated by Peppermint Patty and Marcie, who are pursuing their own crushes on him. This is the second Peanuts special themed around Valentine's Day, following 1975's Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown. 
Everybody likes Valentine's Day, all except for Good Old Charlie Brown, who's suffered just about every Valentine's Day without getting a Valentine. As with every February, Charlie Brown was sitting right in front of his letter box, waiting for someone to send him a valentine card. </p>
