        <h2><strong>valentines day japanlife reddit valentines day movies funny</strong></h2>
        <p>I just do stuff on Valentine's because it's easier. You can get restaurant bookings, buy flowers etc the day of, and it's rarely an issue because so few guys do it. Plus, y'know, it's actually Valentine's Day (yes, yes, it's a made up Hallmark holiday, whatever). Looks like someone is sad they don't have a significant other. 
All kinds of pretty pinks and reds on it, with some rose embroidered all around - just perfect for Valentine's Day! Once I had it finished up, we went for a walk to Osaka Castle Park to see the plum blossoms and try the STBX Valentine's Day chocolate almond milk latte special thing. The blossoms are pretty so far, but not quite all opened up yet. 
A simple Google search of something like "japan valentine's day chocolate giving" would tell you that chocolate giving on Valentine's Day by girls to guys (and on White Day to reciprocate/repay the favor by guys to girls) is a normal Japanese cultural thing. It appears in anime and video games (like the Persona series) that take place in Japan too. 
This. Lesbian couples give each other chocolate on Valentine's day. Because both parties are women. They usually don't do things on white day since that's for men to give stuff. Lesbian here, so I'm not sure how it works for gay men. I have gay male friends and they've never given me anything on Valentine's, only white day. 
Valentine's day is on the horizon and I am want to buy some chocolates for my boyfriend but I have not been living here long. I am in Kagoshima while boyfriend lives in Tokyo, so I won't be able to see him until relocate to Tokyo in April, which means that I will mis Valentine's day. 
Go to japanlife r/japanlife. r/japanlife  choices and messages that come with Valentine's Day chocolate.  closed in protest of Reddit's attempt to kill third  
Go to japanlife r/japanlife. r/japanlife  You can simply write a Valentine's Day message on one: buying one of those'll likely save you a great deal of time  
From what I understand White Day is for the girls, Valentine’s Day is for the guys. Do you guys have any cool stories about either: A.) Receiving a gift B.) Giving a gift What about love notes? Are they really common, or more of a stereotypical thing? Thanks for sharing! Cheers. 
Men of /r/japanlife, will you buy chocolates on Valentines Day?  true 
it can be an extension of girichoco (obligation chocolate) but generally uncommon since white day is male giving equivalent. I wouldn't say forbidden, especially if you're not Japanese - male coworkers or friends would probably just laugh &amp; thank you for the chocolates, or try to explain Valentine's vs. White day to you. 
TIL that in Japan, Valentine's Day is a day when girls buy chocolates and other gifts for boys they like. A month later, on March 14th, is called White Day. On that day, the boys will buy gifts to give back to the girls who bought them gifts on Valentine's Day. 
Find the best posts and communities about Valentine's Day on Reddit 
I work at a eikaiwa with 5 female co-workers who i'm on amiable but not really close terms with, and a class of ~15 kids each day. Of them, 2 co-workers and 3 students gave me chocolate for Valentine's Day. 
823K subscribers in the japan community. This subreddit serves as a general hub to discuss most things Japanese and exchange information, **as well 
I am a 25-year-old woman and I love men and I love Valentine’s Day. Here is my advice for you. Get 1 thing that is a traditional romantic gift, and get 1 thing that says something about your girlfriend’s personality. Or, even better, combine the two. For example, if she loves whales, you could get her candy that’s shaped like whales. 
For mine and my SO's anniversary (which is only a week and a half off from Valentine's Day), I did a 365 note jar. The idea is that the person gets to open up one note every day for the next year with a message of some sort from you, usually things like your favorite memories with them, reasons you love/appreciate them. 
Well, you can do any general-purpose romantic date stuff that they have available all year long. Take her out to a nice restaurant and go for a ride on daikanransha afterwards, or a spa day in the mountains. But there's no specific "Valentine's Day" activities in Japan, because we don't celebrate it that way. 
The majority of the men didn't do anything on White Day, so he was seen as one of the few who actually cared. My husband does the lazy version of this, which is bringing in a box of chocolates to be shared and putting it in a central place in the office on Valentine's Day. For this year, I wouldn't worry too much about the cost of your return gift. 
So Valentine’s Day is coming up and I’m obviously in a relationship. But in my past relationships Valentine’s Day was never acknowledged or celebrated in an “aweeee ️” way. So now that Valentine’s Day is coming I just don’t want to celebrate it at all, I told my boyfriend that I just want to act like it’s a regular day. 
On Valentine’s Day, he arranged a mini scavenger hunt around our apartment with clues and decorations while i was at work. There were 3 clues total. The first clue was posted on the door outside of our apartment. I had to find a special candy for the 2nd clue. </p>
