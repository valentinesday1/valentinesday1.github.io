This guide will provide ideas, suggestions, and tips to create a memorable Valentine's Day that goes beyond the ordinary, while spotlighting the essential elements in maintaining the spark  
The party stumbles upon Lover’s Oak - a blessed location for a goddess of romance, said to bless couples married underneath it. A local lord who married under it is getting divorced, and in his rage has ordered it cut down - angering the locals, the druids, and potentially even the goddess who blessed it, any of whom may ask the party to help protect it!

Dungeons and Dragons’ digital companion website D&amp;D Beyond is offering a free one-shot adventure to celebrate Valentine’s Day.‘A Perilous Joy Festival’ is designed for three to four third-level D&amp;D characters, and it tasks players with delivering ‘candy grams’ to a town at the edge of a swamp. 
The day after Valentines is my birthday and I'm hoping to run a themed(ish) campaign sometime around then for our play group. I previously ran one on Halloween that was allegedly successful and hoped to have another slightly smoother and more free-flowing go having learnt lessons.

Maybe the best way to spend Valentine’s day this year is with some good old Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Nothing says romance like casting lightning bolt on a Bullete. If you’re running a game this weekend, try our Valentine’s day themed adventure! Crimson Day. Crimson Day takes place on the 14th day of the second month in the year. 
Ignite the flames of adventure and romance with our DnD Valentine's Day Collection, a trove of enchanting gifts tailored for the tabletop enthusiast in your life. From heart-infused dice sets to love-themed adventure modules, these treasures are designed to celebrate the bonds forged in fantasy realms. 
I just got started on a Valentine's day oneshot. It's called the Bards Lament, a band of heroes help a Bard save her lost love. I would love some lovey dovey monsters/encounters beyond the realm of chocolate box mimics! (Bonus points if the monsters are part of a puzzle) 
Happy Valentine's Day! To celebrate, I'm here to cash out on the hypercommercialisation of our primal instinct to reproduce I present new subclasses themed around this very lovey-dovey holiday. I was able to get it out almost in time for all timezones (sorry aussies and nzers). Needless to say, I'm very proud of myself for it. 
We love a mismatched mani and this Valentine's Day-themed option has it all. The flames, croc accents, 3D details, hearts, and swirls make it a fun and flirty option for all the girlies who don't like to have to choose a single design. 
How to Craft Perfectly Punny and D&amp;D-Themed Valentine's Day Cards. Valentine's Day is a time for love, romance, and—for D&amp;D enthusiasts—adventure.If your idea of affection involves rolling initiative and slaying dragons (or feelings of loneliness), then crafting D&amp;D-themed Valentine’s cards is the perfect way to express your love. 
Valentine's Day Monsters 5th Edition I am thinking of running a high-level (3 level 15 players) Valentine one shot with my group this weekend, for the sake of simplicity I am thinking of making it a gauntlet of monsters representing various types and tropes of love, some of which have become corrupted as love is being drained by a powerful force.
