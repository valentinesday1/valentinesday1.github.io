        <h2><strong>valentines day is pointless putlocker valentines day online</strong></h2>
        <p>I’ve always disliked Valentine’s Day. To me, it was always such a pointless holiday, thought up by the greeting-card industry just to generate some revenue in the off seasons. When I was younger, I used to think it was romantic, a day set aside for people to celebrate their love together. Now that I’m older, I realize how stupid that  
If you want to avoid being “lonely” on Valentine’s Day, just don’t celebrate it. I can understand how not getting a Valentine can make someone upset, but again, Valentine’s Day is a pointless holiday. So don’t celebrate it and you won’t have to worry about not getting any Valentines. 
Valentine’s Day only exists in its modern form to sell cards and chocolates at an otherwise slow time of the year. We really don’t have any other major holidays between Christmas/New Year’s and Easter (yes St Patrick’s Day but you don’t really buy gifts/candy as much for that) 
Of all the useless holidays we celebrate in America, I think Valentine’s Day is hands-down the worst of the bunch. This is in comparison to holidays such as Drinking Straw Day, Dress Up Your Pet Day and Talk Like a Pirate Day. Those kinds of holidays at least have an amusing purpose, do not really

Overall, Valentine’s Day is a holiday that causes plenty of problems, leads to more stress than joy in some instances, and should be left to be alone in a bin like all the discounted chocolate put up for clearance that people can get as soon as February 15 rolls around. 
But what is the true meaning of Valentine’s day? Is an important day that celebrates love, or is it a pointless holiday used by corporations to make money? Love- Lena “Gaby” Holmes. Although corporations, like Hallmarks, have encroached on Valentine’s Day and tried to make it a corporate holiday, Valentine’s Day is still a day for love. 
Where did Valentine’s Day originate? For years, the consensus among historians was that the holiday had something to do with an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia that fell in mid-February. Noel Lenski, a Yale University historian, pointed to the seasonal and thematic connections between Lupercalia and modern Valentine’s Day. 
Valentine’s Day is more than romance; it celebrates love in all forms. Its history blends ancient and Christian traditions, emphasizing connection and appreciation. 
Here’s your Valentine’s Day streaming list, no matter how you feel about Valentine’s Day. To be truly climate-conscious, you should skip the winter flower bouquet. 
Valentine's day just makes the single feel awful because it reminds them that they don't have someone; while others are posting selfies with their partner with some godawfully cringy captions like "Living my best life 🥰💖💞" 
Valentine’s Day Isn’t About “Real Love” Show how much you love them with this diamond blah blah blah. Every jewelry store commercial around Valentine’s Day. Give the gift of performance or luxury or whatever the fuck we’re selling. Every car commercial around Valentine’s Day. I’m not against romance. In fact, it’s quite the

For many single people though, Valentine's Day can feel quite pointless and lonely without a significant other. However, Valentine's Day can be celebrated by anyone, even if you are without a date this year. Here is a list of fun things for single people to do in Columbia during Valentine’s Day. Create your own Valentine's playlist 
Valentine’s Day is similarly structured and similarly pointless and as of no, there are only two camps that you can celebrate it with: the “annoying couples on Facebook” and the “quirky anti-valentiners”. 
Despite all this, I still like the idea of Valentine’s day. But whether you decide to celebrate it or not this year, do it because you want to and remember that love should be celebrated every day. Romance is nice to have but Valentines Day shouldn't be limited to dates or Anti-valentines day bashes. 
Valentine's day is pointless. I fully believe valentines day is a load of rubbish. If you love someone, multiple people or even just yourself, why do you need one day a year to do that and celebrate it, when it should be something you do every day. 
Everyday you should show your appreciation, not for just one day!
