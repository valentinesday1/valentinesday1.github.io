Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms is urging users to stay vigilant about “ romance scams ” ahead of Valentine’s Day, warning of unsolicited messages through its apps and other social media platforms, as well as general text messages. Scammers tend to pose as “attractive, single and successful individuals,” Meta says.

Valentine's Day is celebrated in many countries around the world and has become yet another media and product sales frenzy, much the same as celebrating Mother's Day and Father's Day. What important is not to buy into all the hype. Stick to celebrating this day  
What kind of message would you think this would send? My idea of doing it is a simple "hey, look, I've been thinking about you" and I think she might appreciate a little surprise on that day. Her random thoughtful text messages to me definitely surprised me and made me feel good, so I figured I'd return the favor by randomly surprising her on V  
My ex- divorced over 5 years sent me a gift last year- it terrified me! I gave it to our kids- then I learned he had recently moved in with another woman. I’m pretty sure he was trying to put on a show to convince her what a great guy he is.
