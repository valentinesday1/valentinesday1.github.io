        <p>SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) â€“ Spending Valentineâ€™s Day alone, even during a pandemic, is hard. However, with COVID-19 restrictions in place, there is no better time to stay home with the best companion of all; your pet. With that in mind, here are 14 ways to make sure your Valentineâ€™s Day isnâ€™t so ruff, according [] 
Being alone isnâ€™t the same as being lonely! Explore the benefits of being alone on Valentineâ€™s Day and get 10 ideas for how to spend the holidays solo. Valentineâ€™s Day has a way of making single people feel like they should be sobbing into a heart-shaped pizza while the couples they know frolic through a rom-com montage. 
But donâ€™t let flying solo put a damper on Cupidâ€™s day. Instead, celebrate it with pets. Theyâ€™re the real masters of unconditional love, after all. If you have pets at home, there are plenty of fun things you can do to show them your love on Valentineâ€™s Day. And if you donâ€™t have a pet, itâ€™s an easy fix. 
Itâ€™s a fulfilling way to celebrate Valentineâ€™s Day, spreading love and happiness beyond your immediate circle. Together with your pet, brighten the day for shelter animals and contribute to a community of caring. 14. Organize A Pet Fashion Show 
Because at the end of the day, Valentineâ€™s Day is meant to be a celebration of loveâ€”with yourself, your family, your friends, your pet, your communityand yeah, sure, your love interest too. 
Spending Valentineâ€™s Day alone is a chance to revel in your independence, something that many coupled people probably envy. Itâ€™s an opportunity to spend your time exactly as you see fit, with the activities, food, drinks, and gifts that you want to enjoy. You donâ€™t have to compromise with anyone, and thatâ€™s a gift in itself. 
3. Take Your Dog to Dinner. If you want to go out for a nice meal but donâ€™t want to go by yourself, take your pooch out to dinner and celebrate Valentineâ€™s Day with your actual best friend. 
I try to get ahead of the price jump by purchasing flowers from a local shop ahead of time so I can appreciate the blooms on the actual day. Valentineâ€™s Day itself usually includes a facial, extra long and hot shower, a trip to a local pastry shop, a massage at the local spa, mani-pedi, and scattered phone calls to family and older friends  
Your dog will love having a few extra hours to run and play, and you can spend that time making some new friends with other dog owners (or finding a date for later in the day). If you donâ€™t get to spend a lot of time playing with your dog on regular days because of your work schedule, Valentineâ€™s Day is a perfect time to spend some extra  
There are many reasons why you may find yourself alone on Valentine's day. Maybe you've chosen to be single or are not interested in a relationship. It's also possible that you're single for reasons outside of your control. For instance, maybe you're dealing with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and experience some fear in pursuing a romantic  
Maybe because I help out at my parents' facility from time to time. It's a good to spend Valentine's day. Thanks. Bronwen Scott-Branagan from Victoria, Australia on January 09, 2019: An interesting article, but I'm sorry that you have not mentioned the real name of the day, St. Valentine's Day; nor did you mention the saint after whom it is named. 
Love is in the air, and people arenâ€™t hesitating to splurge on their loved ones this Valentineâ€™s Day.Consumers will spend a record $27.5 billion this holiday, an average of $188.81 per person  
This is your day to indulge. Maybe try your hand at baking cookies, a cake, or bread. The process is soothing, and the result is a delicious treat. 11. Create a Vision Board. Gather magazines, printouts, or Pinterest images and create a vision board for your dreams and goals. Use this day to focus on your aspirations. Maybe even draft a plan. 
Rethinking being alone on Valentineâ€™s Day. While it may be common to dread Valentineâ€™s Day and its themes of love, romance, and coupledom, a simple perspective shift can help you move past your feelings of negativity and isolation and tap into a sense of freedom and gratitude.

PEOPLE spoke with Lane Moore, author of How to Be Alone: If You Want To, And Even If You Don't and host of the Tinder Live show, about how to spend Valentine's Day â€” a holiday that is usually  
Valentine's day reminds me how lonely I am everyone had someone who cares about them. This special day reminds me of how I will never have a relationship with anyone because I don't know what it's like to be loved, never recieved gifts from anyone either and I have no friends and have nobody to spend time with besides my family who makes me feel worse. 
While some people may dread Valentineâ€™s Day and its related story of love, romance, and coupledom, others might experience a sense that they are free and liberated. Some single people are thankful they get the time and space to spend Valentineâ€™s Day with themselves, their friends, or family members rather than a romantic partner.
