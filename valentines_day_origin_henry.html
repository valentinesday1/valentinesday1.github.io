        <p>Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts  
King Henry VIII officially declared February 14 as the St. Valentine's Day holiday in 1537, marking the first Valentine's Day. Chocolates became an important gift for Valentine's Day due to Richard Cadbury's affordable and accessible chocolate box, adorned with cupids and roses, in 1861. 
Bearing cards, flowers, chocolates and poetry, lovers have always swooned on Valentine’s Day as cherubs circled overhead. Right? Or is the history darker, marked by Roman bacchanalia, martyrs and lies? Innumerable legends claim to explain the origins of Valentine’s Day, but as is the case with legends, they leave many questions unanswered. 
The Tudors made the most of the occasion, and in 1537, King Henry VIII--who loved to be in love--decreed by Royal Charter that Valentine's Day would become a holiday in England. It was popularly believed that the first person an individual met on that day (though not a family member) would be their Valentine, and if you were choosy you would

What part does Cupid play on Valentine's Day? Of course, it's not all about St. Valentine. Cupid — the winged baby boy often seen on Valentine's Day cards and paraphernalia — is another symbol of this love-filled holiday, and it's easy to understand why. In Roman mythology, Cupid was the son of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty. 
But, since his contemporaries were more familiar with the Feb. 14 Saint Valentine’s Day, that was the date that became attached to the new holiday of romance. In some ways, that may be a good thing. 
By the early 1910s, an American company that would one day become Hallmark began distributing its more official "Valentine's Day cards." The rest, as they say, is history. Universal Images Group / Getty Images 
Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It may have had beginnings in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which celebrated the coming of spring and included fertility rites and other activities, but the origin of the holiday is vague at best.

Couples exchange cards, flowers, chocolates, and tokens of affection, while others take the day to appreciate their friendships and family bonds.
