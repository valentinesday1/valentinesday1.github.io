        <h2><strong>my boyfriend didn t spend valentines day with me south lake tahoe valentines day 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Obviously I can’t give his side on my birthday situation, but he didn’t get me anything until the day of, and then didn’t plan a place to eat after just said “I don’t know we could go to eat at X place”. I told him later that I wanted to be thought of more, like more thought into the gift or the dinner/activity. 
I told my boyfriend to plan something for valentines day No you didn't. You said "You do something nice and romantic on valentines dayI just want some romantic time with you" Nothing about planning something special. I had to check the ages. You're acting like 17 not 27. Grow up. Use words more effectively. He's not a mind-reader. 
I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
He has told me what i want to do for my birthday our birthdays is on a Monday and he works that day , He even told me that he doesn't know if he wants to request it off or just work since his birthday is a holiday and he said it might be busy, basically he told me his going work so that means i won't even be with him , only on the weekend. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
Reasons You Got Nothing For Valentine’s Day With Your Boyfriend Some Men Don’t Know. I’m truly sorry to serve you the news when you don’t want to believe in them. Some men seriously underestimate the importance of Valentine’s Day for women. They don’t know how much a flower would mean to us on that day. 
If your new partner doesn’t want to do something special for Valentine’s Day and you do, this suggests he’s just not that into you, or may signal important information about clashing values. Valentine’s Day, like many holidays, often tap into traditions and messages you’ve internalized since early childhood. 
It doesn’t take a genius to know that a sweet gesture for Valentine’s Day, birthday, Mother’s/Father’s Day, Christmas, Anniversary goes a long way with a partner. 5 events in a year with  
The guy I am dating didn't get me anything for Valentine's Day. But we'd already said we think buying because commercialised shops say we should wasn't reallt what we are about. We did, however, spend the day together, watch Netflix and order ridiculously unhealthy food. I think he should have visited you, at least, with it being a new thing. 
"Personally, I've never been into Valentine's Day and my guy isn't either. Last year we just spent the day lazy in bed and went out for dinner. We didn't do a big show of it, just a simple weekend  
The only thing is the stuff I've seen about a guy missing Valentine's day with his girlfriend is a red flag, and I realized it was kinda off that he forgot and planned a day out where he couldn't text me specifically on Valentine's and leading into the next day where he might not be home either

My dad isn't into holidays at all and he wasn't very involved in my life but the one things he DID do was always send me flowers on valentines day. I'm not looking for gifts or to be doted on, but I was looking forward to spending time with him knowing that it was a little extra special in a way. 
That's your own damn fault. It's just a day. Not even your anniversary. Me and my gf didn't even bring up that it's Valentines day. anything I said just sounded selfish when I put it into words. Not selfish, but childish. 
He has his daughter full-time so it’s not a question of not seeing her enough. We also don’t live together, he texted me happy valentines day this morning and told me his plans to have dinner at home with his daughter, didn’t invite me and didn’t plan anything with me. I am left to spend Valentine's Day alone in my apartment. 
Short &amp; Sweet Valentine’s Day Messages for Your Boyfriend. 1. “Happy Valentine’s Day, my love! Every single day with you feels special, but today, I just want to remind you how much you mean to me. I love you endlessly!” 2. “You’re my favorite person, my biggest blessing, and the love of my life. 
Okay, so I really want to spend Valentine’s Day with my girlfriend (of about 4 months) but she decided that she was going to accept plans with her two friends (male and female) instead of hanging out with me because the female friend didn’t want to be alone on Valentine’s day. Which of course, leaves me alone. 
As an example: If my way to offer and receive affection for my special someone is through sharing quality time with them and they just blow me off on Valentine's Day, I'd probably feel hurt too, unless we'd both discussed it and decided that Valentine's day didn't really hold any significance for us. 
To my best friend this Valentine's Day, I couldn't ask for someone who loves and supports me more than you do — wishing you a beautiful day filled with all the love and happiness you deserve. 
I never got it, never got something to my girlfriend on valentines day cause it's just every other day, except society expect you to spend money for your S/O without any logical reason. Sounds like he did say yes in the first place because he didn't want to hurt you, but maybe he's like me, he don't see why you expect more on the 14th february  </p>
