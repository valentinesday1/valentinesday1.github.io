At the end of the day, it's either a night for romance or National Single Awareness Day whether you like it or not. 2 The last reason is when you are in a relationship on Valentine's, the holiday becomes a test for relationships.

This is usually done through romantic gestures such as flowers, chocolates, jewelry and other.
