        <h2><strong>why does valentines day suck 5 minute crafts valentines day cards</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is the one day of the year that you're expected to be better looking, a better lover, a more fascinating conversationalist, the buyer of the perfect gift, and the planner of the  
A boyfriend once broke up with me on February 12 and asked if he could call on Valentine’s Day, “so neither of us will really be alone.” How oddly sweet. The call never came, and I heard he was engaged to some ingenue within a month. I’m sure you’ve experienced the exact same thing. Everybody hates red. And if they don’t, they should. 
So, if the idea of Valentine’s Day has you in a slump, remember, it’s just one day, and perhaps all you need to get through those 24 hours is to ride out the short-term wave of happiness that  
British blogger Emily Hartridge, who has previously expounded on reasons why dating sucks and why it might be time to break up, took it upon herself to outline all of the reasons why Valentine's Day sucks. "I actually did want to put a positive spin on Valentine's Day," Hartridge says. 
Valentine's Day itself does not get a lot of love in the scientific literature, but a few scattered studies hint at why it inspires hate. See if any of the reasons to hate Valentine's Day ring  
Valentine's Day can be fun when you're in the right mood. But there are a variety of reasons Valentine's Day can suck, as well.It's so easy to let your expectations get too high, for example, and  
For the past six years, my partner and I have tried to do Valentine’s Day “right”: We’ve gone all-in with thoughtful (yet costly) gifts, overpriced dinners booked weeks in advance, and  
And these are my seven reasons why: 1. I don't care for traditions. The tradition of celebrating romantic love on Valentine's Day might date back to fifth century Roman times, but so do gladiatorial tiger fights. And child slavery. 
Valentine's Day is often dismissed as a crass commercialisation of love that allows businesses to cash in on sales of cards, flowers, chocolates, upmarket restaurant bookings, expensive theatre  
People were complaining in women’s magazines in the late 19th century that Valentine’s Day was too commercial. “Everybody’s always expecting Valentine’s Day to die out, and it never does,” she said. “It’s sort of like saying, ‘Coney Island’s too crowded. Nobody goes there anymore.’” 
A survey found that 64% of respondents think Valentine’s Day is overrated. Others feel it creates pressure and unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment. For singles, the day can highlight loneliness, making them feel excluded from the festivities. But here’s my take: Valentine’s Day is the perfect holiday. 
And lets be honest, Valentine’s Day doesn’t exactly cater to the single crowd. For many, it’s less about love and more about questioning why we don’t have it in the first place. 
It has nothing to do with being in love or being single. I've been in a relationship on Valentine's Day, and I've been alone. Both suck equally as much. For years, my friends have called me the  
In my opinion, Valentine’s Day actually kinda sucks Here’s why: It’s ONE day out of 365. No matter what origin story you decide to believe when it comes to Valentine’s Day, one fact remains, February 14th is the day of love. What I don’t particularly like is the idea that one day out of the year is more special than any other. 
Sometimes being single on Valentine’s Day sucks. But, hear me out for a second. Instead of Valentine’s Day being a day that reminds you of how alone you are, let it be a reminder of how  
Say you do find yourself on a date on Valentine’s Day. There are still ways to end up disappointed and mad at the end of the day. Even after you have bought that special someone flowers and chocolate, we all know there will be that one couple who goes all-out to show off its love. 
5 REASONS WHY PEOPLE ACTUALLY HATE VALENTINE'S DAY: Valentine’s Day is an every year love fair. It comes, excites the love-struck brain and leaves with a hole in most pockets. But, somewhere  
I understand how polarising and contentious this may be for those out there who, like, actually like Valentine’s Day and probably, like, use love heart filters on Snapchat and like, cry while  
As for Valentine’s Day, I really only remember it as a family thing and (elementary) school event (ie. giving eachother cards &amp; candy). Did you not like the 14th before theese bad luck days you’ve had or do you believe your experiences on those days may have caused it? /serious /genuine </p>
