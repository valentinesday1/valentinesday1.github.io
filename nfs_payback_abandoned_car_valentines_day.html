Abandoned Cars are cars in Need for Speed: Payback that were hidden across Fortune Valley and had a rotating window of availability. They were introduced with the December Update released on December 19, 2017, and the selection of possible vehicles was increased as part of the June Update released on June 19, 2018. The rotation of cars ran from the mode's introduction on December 19, 2017 to

Hey man, thanks for your reply. I just need some clarification. The link you sent me is of abandoned car wraps/visual customization but not the abandoned cars feature, because in the full feature you get the abandoned car in the game and then there is a cop chase till you get the car to RAV. 
NFS Payback is the perfect definition of 3 steps forward/30 steps back and also everything that's wrong with the Need For Speed license. These gameplay design mistakes proves that NFS Payback isn't enjoyable at all: No freeroam cops since they were scripted via missions, bait crates and abandoned cars. Unnecessary In-App purchases.

Unfortunately no, those cars were released on a schedule and you had to be connected to internet to get them. now that Payback support is over i doubt they will ever release the abandoned cars again.
