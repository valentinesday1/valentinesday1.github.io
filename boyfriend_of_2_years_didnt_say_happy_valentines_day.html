All day we see signs in stores, talking about love, posts online, text from friends, chocolate filled hearts aplenty. It ‘ s everywhere and, when your boyfriend forgets Valentine ‘ s Day, the day is horrible. That being said, don ‘ t forget that the day after Valentine ‘ s Day is just another day. Another day when life goes on. 
Happy Valentine's Day, friend! It's really unfortunate that he didn't at least say the words to you :(. There's nothing wrong with you! It's been a common thread on this sub today that some boyfriends "don't believe in Valentines Day" or "won't celebrate [it]". This could be the case! 
At the end of the day, what truly matters is the connection and love you share with your partner. Valentine's Day is just one day on the calendar, and a gift, or the lack thereof, shouldn't define your relationship. The most valuable thing is the time and effort you both invest in maintaining a strong and loving bond. 
Screw the pink cards and chocolates though. If he was REALLY smooth, he'll disappoint you on Valentines day, then on the 15th surprise you with something really wonderful/elaborate. i.e. Make gf happy while telling Valentine's Day to go fuck itself. 
After five dates, on the Saturday before Valentine's Day, we slept together. Valentine's Day comes and goes and he didn't mention it to me, didn't ask me out, or even say "Happy Valentines" day to me. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
It doesn’t take a genius to know that a sweet gesture for Valentine’s Day, birthday, Mother’s/Father’s Day, Christmas, Anniversary goes a long way with a partner. 5 events in a year with  
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
For the past six years, my partner and I have tried to do Valentine’s Day “right”: We’ve gone all-in with thoughtful (yet costly) gifts, overpriced dinners booked weeks in advance, and  
927 votes, 364 comments. I’m just tired of feeling like the only one who cares. I asked him, two to three weeks ago, to plan something for 
Sorry I meant to say 11 months. Our anniversary is at the end of the month. I don't know I say a few. I think I say it automatically because it hasn't been a year yet! 
Yesterday I was waiting for my boyfriend to wish me a happy Valentine’s Day but when it came around 6 o’clock and he still didn’t say anything about it I brought up how it hurt my feeling because I felt like he forgot it was valentines and he knew we already couldn’t see each other because of work and travel distance. 
Happy Valentine's Day Messages for Boyfriend "Happy Valentine's Day to the love of my life. You make every day brighter!" "I'm so lucky to call you mine. Happy Valentine's Day, my heart!" "To my one and only: Happy Valentine's Day. I love you more than words can say!" "You make my world a better place; happy Valentine's Day, my love!" 
I’ve (29F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for about a year and a half. We’ve talked about my past relationships and they all ended because they never put any effort in. I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get 
I really like Valentine’s Day and I want to be able to celebrate it but my boyfriend does not. He thinks it’s dumb and someone’s love for someone shouldn’t be summed up into one day. This always leads into fights with us mainly because he won’t compromise to at least say happy Valentine’s Day to each other. 
All day we see signs in stores, talking about love, posts online, text from friends, chocolate filled hearts aplenty. It’s everywhere and, when your boyfriend forgets Valentine’s Day, the day is horrible. That being said, don’t forget that the day after Valentine’s Day is just another day.

Hi! I am also in a long distance relationship and also frustrated with the lack of acknowledgment my boyfriend gave. I too am not super into Valentine’s Day and was not expecting a gift or anything, but fully expected him to say “Happy Valentine’s Day” which he didn’t. You are not alone at all and I understand how you feel. 
Being in love is a beautiful feeling. Your boyfriend will start the day on a high note if he wakes up to a cute message from you. Writing Happy Valentine's Day messages for your boyfriend comes  
My fiancé didn't get me anything for V-Day for 15 years. This year, he surprised me with 2 gifts. The whole V-Day frenzy about "oh, you have to get your SO a gift or flowers or they'll be mad" is so frustrating.
