        <p>Valentine’s Day is literally built for indulgence — so we say why not make yourself the priority? Here are 12 relaxation ideas to reduce stress and anxiety. 3. Throw a Galentine’s (or Palentine’s) party. Valentine’s Day isn’t just about romance — it’s about all kinds of love. 
If you are single and spending Valentine's Day alone this year, there are plenty of ways to distract yourself (and maybe even forget about the holiday altogether!). While you're at it, try to remind yourself of how wonderful you are and show yourself some compassion. 
So, take this Valentine’s Day to celebrate the most important relationship you’ll ever have: the one with yourself. Whether you’re dancing around your living room, writing in your journal, or stargazing under the night sky, remember that you are enough, just as you are. Happy Valentine’s Day to you sweetie!

It is also a day for parents to express their love for their children, to express love for friends, and to enjoy some self-love too.

According to the AARP, 26% of single adults report feeling lonely on Valentine’s Day, and 23% of adults—whether single, in a relationship, or dating—have negative feelings about the holiday. While feeling lonely or isolated may be natural, it’s possible to combat negativity by reframing and celebrating being single Valentine’s Day. 
Hobbies are a good way to keep yourself occupied on Valentine’s Day and also help you keep off the pressure that comes with the day. Whether it is painting, reading a book, exercising, or  
Valentine’s Day is not everyone’s favorite holiday. Instead of a Valentine’s Day themed party, pick a different theme to eliminate any Valentine’s Day reservations your friends might have. Make the party “Anti-Valentine’s Day” themed, or choose a random theme that all of your friends will enjoy. 
Treat Yourself to a Luxurious Self-Care Day. Dedicate the day to self-pampering. Run a warm bath infused with essential oils, put on a hydrating face mask, and unwind with soothing music.
