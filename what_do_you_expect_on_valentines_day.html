Today, chocolates are one of the top gifts exchanged on Valentine’s Day, with everything from fancy truffles to giant chocolate bars making their way into hearts and hands. 
Whatever you do, don’t open Instagram to see what other couples are doing on Valentine’s Day, especially the ones who have been together for years. They’re in an established relationship, so

If you're spending the morning apart, you can still start things off right. Consider a virtual breakfast or coffee date. Just prop the phone up and video-chat as you each get ready for your day. 
More than 250 million roses are produced for Valentine's Day, according to the Society of American Florists—with red roses making up nearly two-thirds of that number.

I do care about Valentine's day when I'm in a relationship, but I wouldn't expect anything from someone I'm not exclusive with. Even if things were going well, 5-7 dates in is too soon for that IMO. If you wanted, you could get them candy or something else small as a nice gesture.
