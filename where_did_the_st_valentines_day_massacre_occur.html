This day would not only mark one of the most brutal mob killings in history, but it would also end the North and South side battle for power. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre occurred about 10:30 a.m. on February 14, 1929, inside the S.M.C. Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street on the north side of Chicago. Seven men associated with George “Bugs” Moran’s bootlegging operation were waiting inside the garage, presumably for a meeting to buy a hijacked shipment of  
On Valentine’s Day in 1929, the American city of Chicago woke up to the news of a gruesome murder where seven men lay sprawled on the cold concrete of a Lincoln Park garage, their bodies riddled with bullets. According to reports, the killers were possibly police officers who had tricked their victims into believing they faced a routine arrest. However, it soon became apparent that it was  
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre was violent and shocking in a way that had become Capone’s trademark — and this put significant pressure on officials to crack down on gang activity in Chicago. In many ways, the massacre marked the beginning of the end of a certain wild west period in the underworld of Chicago, even the country as a whole. 
On February 15, 1936, nearly seven years to the day of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, McGurn was gunned down at a bowling alley. Bugs Moran was quite shaken from the entire incident. He stayed in Chicago until the end of Prohibition and then was arrested in 1946 for some small-time bank robberies. 
The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre is the name given to the shooting of seven people (six of them gangsters) as part of a Prohibition Era conflict between two powerful criminal gangs in Chicago, Illinois, in the winter of 1929: The South Side Italian gang led by Al "Scarface" Capone and the North Side Irish/German gang led by George "Bugs" Moran. 
As far as mass murders go, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre is one of the trickiest, best-crafted slaughters of the 1920s. The year was 1929; the day was Valentine's Day, and all was quiet in Bugs Moran's place of operation, the SMC Cartage Co. garage, located at 2122 North Clark Street in Chicago. 
A commercial garage on the north side of Chicago was the setting for the most horrific shooting in Mob history, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre.

The Saint Valentine’s Day massacre remains seared into Chicago’s memory as one of its bloodiest episodes and a symbol of the gun violence, bootlegging and criminal underworld that riddled the city during the prohibition era. 
Much like the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the Massacre has been the subject of many book and film adaptations, either in direct adaptations like the 1959 film Al Capone, the 1967 film The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, or as an off-screen, background event as in 1987’s The Untouchables with Kevin Costner as Ness and Robert DeNiro as Capone. 
To this day, in early 2024, no one has ever been arrested for the murders that occurred during the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Several factors played into the lack of arrests. The biggest issue was that the man who is assumed to have ordered the massacre, Al Capone, was vacationing in Florida at the time it occurred. 
In a mob hit known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, seven members of George "Bugs" Moran's gang were gunned down in a Chicago garage on February 14, 1929. Though Al Capone was the prime suspect, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre remains unsolved. 
It happened to be St Valentine’s Day, the day for delivering tender tokens of affection, when a Cadillac, ostensibly a police car, drove up to the building at around 10.50 am and five men got out. Witness statements varied over details, but it seems that two of the men were in police uniforms and the other three in ordinary civilian clothes. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Feb. 14th, 1929. Seven men machine-gunned to death in Chicago. Al Capone was suspected, but as The Mob Museum will show you, nothing was what it seemed.
