Now, that all kind of seems to be forgotten — at least at my kid’s school, and there’s one particular rule for her Valentine’s Day party that really bummed me out. Her teacher sent instructions about the party and writing Valentine's cards, including no food (understandable!) and that the kids would make their own bags at school. </p>
