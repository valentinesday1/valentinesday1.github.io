        <h2><strong>did fred killer burke lead the st valentines day assailants valentines day profile frames</strong></h2>
        <p>Fred "Killer" Burke (May 29, 1893 – July 10, 1940) was an American armed robber and contract killer responsible for many crimes during the Prohibition era. He was considered a prime suspect in the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. 
When the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre occurred on February 14, 1929, Burke was among the prime suspects. He went into hiding in rural Michigan. On December 14, 1929 — 10 months after the Massacre — he was involved in a car accident in St. Joseph, Michigan, where he was known as “Frederick Dane.” 
Officers also found trap doors, dozens of disguises, several well-thumbed detective novels, and some $390,000 worth of bonds stolen in November of 1929 from a Jefferson, Wisconsin, bank. A fingerprint lifted from a household object returned as belonging to Fred "Killer" Burke, lead suspect in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and many other crimes. 
On Valentine’s Day in 1929, the American city of Chicago woke up to the news of a gruesome murder where seven men lay sprawled on the cold concrete of a Lincoln Park garage, their bodies riddled with bullets. According to reports, the killers were possibly police officers who had tricked their victims into believing they faced a routine arrest. However, it soon became apparent that it was  
Bungalow residence in Stevensville, Michigan thought to be that of Fred Dane but on December 14, 1929, after St. Joseph Police Officer Charles Skelly was gunned down, it was learned that Fred Dane was actually Fred "Killer" Burke. Residence is located on Red Arrow Highway south of Glenlord Road on the east side of road. 
The St. Valentine's Day Massacre was a particularly bloody chapter in organized crime history. Seven men from Chicago's North Side Gang, headed by George Clarence "Bugs" Moran, were murdered by Thompson submachine guns in a warehouse on Valentine's Day, 1929. 
Fred “Killer” Burke (1893-1940) Gangster in St. Louis, Detroit and Chicago. Two Tommy guns used in the Massacre were found at his home in rural Michigan in 1930. In 1931, Burke was convicted of murdering a police officer in Michigan and spent the last nine years of his life in prison for that crime. 
As for Machine Gun Jack McGurn, he was repeatedly arrested on many charges, including complicity in the St. Valentine’s Day massacre, but never convicted. Once, trapped by police in a hotel room on West Washington street, he had in his possession a machine gun loaded with dumdum bullets, two automatic pistols, and a quantity of cartridges. 
The case went quiet for many months until the Michigan police arrested Fred “Killer” Burke, another suspect of the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. In his apartment they found a trunk containing a bullet-proof vest, almost $320,000 in bonds recently stolen from a Wisconsin bank, two machine guns and further ammunitions. 
The case stagnated until December 14, 1929, when the Berrien County, Michigan Sheriff’s Department raided the St. Joseph, Michigan bungalow of “Frederick Dane”, the registered owner of a vehicle driven by Fred “Killer” Burke. Burke had been drinking that night, then rear-ended another vehicle and drove off.

The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Feb. 14th, 1929. Seven men machine-gunned to death in Chicago. Al Capone was suspected, but as The Mob Museum will show you, nothing was what it seemed. 
The Valentine's Day Massacre set off a public outcry which posed a problem for all bosses of the National Crime Syndicate. [10] Within days, Capone received a summons to testify before a Chicago grand jury on charges of federal Prohibition violations, but he said he was too unwell to attend.

The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, as it became known, cemented Chicago’s place in the history of organized crime and put a target on the back of the famed mobster Al Capone, who was widely  
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre exceeded any gangland killings before or after February 14, 1929, throwing the city into a frenzy of police activity, awakening the Chicago Crime Commission, and dismaying civic-minded businessmen who were tired of hearing their city called the world's “gangster capital.”Coroner Herman Bundesen, wielding more authority than any medical examiner before or

DOWAGIAC — While the infamous 1929 gang shooting may have occurred on the North Side of The Windy City, it was through the investigative efforts of law enforcement officials in southwest Michigan that brought one of the men responsible for the bloody St. Valentine’s Day Massacre to justice. Michigan author Chriss Lyon detailed the historic two-year [] 
By this time police photos confirmed that Dane was in fact Fred Burke, wanted by the Chicago police for his participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. When police raided Burke's bungalow, they found a large trunk containing a bullet-proof vest, almost $320,000 in bonds recently stolen from a Wisconsin bank, two Thompson submachine guns  
But why did Burke flee to St. Joseph after the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre? “Because it was ‘Capone’s Playground.” explained historian, author and Public Safety Officer Chriss Lyons. In her upcoming book , Capone’s Playground , Lyons writes about 25-year-old Officer Skelly, the capture of Burke (who was actually relieved the police  </p>
