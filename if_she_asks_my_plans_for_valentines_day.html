        <h2><strong>if she asks my plans for valentines day skylanders valentines day box</strong></h2>
        <p>If she asks about your plans for the weekend, it could be a sign that she’s looking for a date or wants to hang out outside of work or school. On the other hand, if she asks about your plans for the day, it could be a more casual inquiry about your schedule. 
"AITA for telling my (22) girlfriend she is ungrateful for saying 'is that it' to Valentine's Day plans?" So we were planning to have a dinner before Valentine's, but she suggested having it on Valentine's which is thought was cool. 
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
"Hey, do you have plans for Valentine's?" She says yes, then he saves himself a rejection. She says no, he can ask her out. Literally no reason not to do this. 
Valentine's Day is often dismissed as a crass commercialisation of love that allows businesses to cash in on sales of cards, flowers, chocolates, upmarket restaurant bookings, expensive theatre  
Yesterday she asked me if I have plans for Valentine's Day and I told her I don't. Well I found out this morning that she already has a boyfriend. I was going to ask her out until she mentioned the BF and then obviously I dropped it. 
1. Valentine’s Day Gifts to Express Your Love: Heartfelt Gifts. A thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift speaks volumes, especially when it is personalized. Things like engraved keepsakes, custom artwork, or personalized home décor not only show your affection but also serve as lasting reminders of your love. 
She’s trying to be coy and figure out if you have valentines plans by not mentioning that it’s valentines. She doesn’t necessarily want to go out with you on Friday (she didn’t ask that), but she does want to make sure that you don’t have plans with someone else. 
Plan a Valentine’s Day game night. My favorite date-night ideas usually involve some sort of fun activity, and Valentine’s Day is no exception. There’s so much you can do beyond pulling out  
Before you ask someone to be your Valentine, you should examine where you two are in your relationship adventure. Some innovative ways to ask someone to be your Valentine are: Send a witty note Create a personalized pizza Write a poem Ask via Scrabble Design a T-shirt. 
depends on his personality honestly. some guys might feel emasculated by the woman taking over when it’s “typically” the man who should make a romantic gesture on vday by planning something nice. or you could hurt his feelings by making him feel like you don’t trust him enough to do something nice for you. but you know him best, so i think as long as you communicate just do what makes  
I like her. We text a lot also. We’ll probably have a third date on Saturday. We don’t know each other super well yet, but I think if the next few dates go well I’d ask her to be my girlfriend. Anyways, I’m not a Valentine’s Day guy at ALL. I don’t think she is either. It actually didn’t cross my mind until I saw the calendar. 
We have a complicated past and she's told me she likes me, but idk cuz things got weird, but lately they've been incredible. I'm just wondering if it's best to shoot the shot rn. Edit: Fuck, here it goes 
The Valentine's Day Dilemma Valentine's Day can feel like a make-or-break moment in relationships, especially when you're still in the early stages. You might be wondering, “Is it too soon to ask her to be my Valentine?” or maybe you're looking for the perfect way to ask without it coming across as awkward. It's a delicate balance. 
Today, I realized that when a girl asks what your plans are for Valentine's Day and you say, "Nothing" and she responds with, "Oh, I don't have any plans either", it  
If you’re unsure about whether you’re even hanging out for the holiday, ask, “What are your V-Day plans?” or boldly say, “I’d love to spend Valentine’s Day with you, are you available?” Otherwise, you’ll be disappointed if the day goes by and you don’t even get a call, let alone a card. 
Um, because it's Valentine's Day. It's the day for romantic gestures, flowers, candy, fancy restaurants, etc. Being a good listener is an everyday trait. If Valentine's Day was for everyday traits, they'd call it Tuesday. You seem to be trying to defend your idea, rather than actually listening to what I've said. 
My bf of 3 years thinks Valentine’s Day is dumb because “we love each other every day”. I told him I love the romance and it’s just a day to something a little more special. My bf is not romantic at all. I asked him to plan something for Valentine’s Day and gave him a bunch of ideas. I told him I’d love flowers too. 
12. Create a playlist. Making a playlist of songs that remind you of your significant other is a sweet way to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Use an app like Spotify, which you probably already have on your phone, and add meaningful songs to your relationship. 
This will be my first Valentine’s day with a girlfriend and I’m so excited. When I asked her how she felt about Valentine’s Day and if she likes to do anything day of or weekend of or anything at all, she said she’s always put in a lot of effort into the day of and always been let down. Sooo, I’m doing my best to make her feel special. </p>
