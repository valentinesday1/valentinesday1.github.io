        <p>Players can queue up for the encounter via the LFG tool. You only have to be Level 10 to queue, however, you only have a chance at X-45 Heartbreaker if you are level 60 or higher. As usual for this holiday, players will be able to engage in a 5-man fight for the safety of Azeroth from this conniving trio of chemists! 
Love is in the Air is the World of Warcraft counterpart of Valentine's Day. The event itself takes place mostly outside of capital cities of both factions. Many rewards can be earned: mounts, gear, pets, achievements, a title, and vanity items. 
Legacy drops, such as the X-45 Heartbreaker, have a much higher chance to drop on your first attempt of the day (WoW account-wide). There is a very small chance to receive legacy drops on subsequent attempts made the same day, for players who enjoy running the content on multiple characters. 
2. Achievements to Complete. Love is in the Air offers a wide range of achievements. Some are playful, while others might require coordination or a bit of RNG luck. 
Love is in the Air is a classic World of Warcraft event - it runs this year for a limited time, from February 3 until February 17, 2025.  (Level 60+, one per day) Love Witch’s Sweeper  
Completion of the twelve holiday achievements for Fool For Love will grant a player title - &lt;Name&gt; the Love Fool. You must be 110 or higher to have a chance to acquire the X-45 Heartbreaker, found in the Heart-Shaped Box. Following the BFA stat squish, the Crown Company necklaces are ilvl 365 for 120 players. 
The vicious Crown Chemical Co. is at large, scheming from within Shadowfang Keep. Help the Steamwheedle Cartel put an end to this threat, and you’ll be fabulously rewarded. Obtain the following item level 378 rewards when you defeat the Crown Chemical Co.: Winking Eye of Love; Choker of the Pure Heart; Heartbreak Charm; Sweet Perfume Broach 
Here’s how to get the X-45 Heartbreaker (and the Love Witch Sweeper) during Love is in the Air. You can queue for the event from your regular Looking for Group pane — it’ll show up as “The Crown Chemical Co.,” and upon getting a group, you’ll be teleported to the courtyard of Shadowfang Keep, where the fight takes place. 
Love is in the Air World Event is a Valentine's day-inspired holiday in World of Warcraft, themed around gifting presents and candy to your loved ones. Love is in the Air 2025 Holiday Updates. Love is in the Air 2025 brings a few new collectibles and changes to the event: Love Witch's Sweeper - Drops from the Heart-Shaped Box. 
Love is in the Air is a seasonal event that takes place around Valentine's Day. The first "Love is in the Air" event occurred in 2006 for about 4 days. In 2010, the event was expanded to about two weeks and additional content added; see Love is in the Air (Classic) for the version on Classic realms. The event was refreshed again in 2024. 
Love is in the Air 2025 in WoW Classic 2024. The “Love is in the Air” event went live on February 11, 2025, and will likely end on February 16, 2025. Love is in the Air Rewards in WoW Classic. During the Love is in the Air valentine’s event in WoW Classic, you’ll be able to gain the following rewards: 
Every February, World of Warcraft has a Valentine’s Day holiday event called Love is in the Air. Holidays in Azeroth have always been a fun side jaunt from the normal questing. Daily quests have no level requirements, although you will need to be level 50 in order to get the Big Love Rocket (the rare flying mount from the special boss). 
What is the level requirement to get the mount? can i queue as a level 10 on a trial account (no current sub) Comment by Chaindog on 2023-02-06T15:13:44-06:00. Just remember that their 0.0001% drop rate even if increased to 0.001% is a massive increase (at least to their marketing of it). We'll STILL be grinding on as many alts as possible. 
The Happily Ever After Event (2025) is the Valentine's Day event for 2025. It is available from February 6 (12:00 AM) to February 19 (11:59 PM), 2025 local time. The below requirements are needed for the event.[1] 
Item Level 226; Binds when picked up; Neck +65 Strength +93 Stamina; Requires Level 80; Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 36 (0.78% @ L80). Equip: Improves hit rating by 45 (1.37% @ L80). Dropped by Apothecary Hummel; Drop Chance: 15.03%; Heartbreak Charm; Item Level 226; Binds when picked up; Neck +63 Stamina +43 Intellect +41 Spirit  
I find the date given as the last day to play the event misleading. When someone says that a particular day is the last day of something, it has always been my understanding that that day is the last full day to do something, usually ending midnight of that day. So, as far as I am concerned, the actual last day of the event is the 15th, not the  
Blizz you suck for hampering the Earthen’s ability to eat regular food. It stops you from eating like normal races, then today discovering they can’t do one chain of quests during Valentine’s Day event because we can’t eat the 5 TREATS required to complete it. 
The Love is in the Air seasonal event is live in World of Warcraft in celebration of Valentine’s Day. For two weeks each year, WoW players can  Your character must be level 50 to be eligible  
This guide documents character level requirements and item level requirements for all the dungeons and outdoor zones in the game, including: At what level range the WoW dungeons are present in the Looking For Dungeon (LFD) tool, both as Specific and Random dungeon. At what level you can enter a dungeon on foot (without using the LFD tool). 
Every year I am completely prepared alt-wise for Valentines event. Look at my mog, I’m very serious about this HAH But this year, with the squish, it makes it hard to know what the minimum level is for a chance for a drop. 51? 55? Do we have any information yet? I would really, really hate to not have as many proper-levelled alts prepared for this once-a-year event/chance. </p>
