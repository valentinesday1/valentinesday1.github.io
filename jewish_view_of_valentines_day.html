        <p>Vatican II, the landmark set of reforms adopted by the Catholic Church in 1969, removed Valentine’s Day from the Catholic church’s calendar, asserting that “though the memorial of St. Valentine is ancient apart from his name nothing is known. Except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on 14 February.” Jewish Considerations. A  
Valentine’s Day is no longer celebrated even by Christians as a Christian holiday. It is a day of love, friendship, and candy, each of which is independently explainable,” he added. However, Rabbi Broyde noted, “I think it is the conduct of the pious to avoid explicitly celebrating Valentine’s Day with a Valentine’s day card.” 
Love is in the air. With the advent of Valentine's Day, the United States Greeting Card Association estimates that roughly 1,000,000,000 greeting cards filled with declarations of love are sent worldwide – and that number doesn't include the flowers, chocolates, jewelry and gifts that have become part of the rituals of this day on the calendar dedicated to expressing the emotion that  
The origins of Valentine’s Day are linked to a saint, though the connections are dubious and even the Catholic Church has removed Valentine's Day from its calendar. Some would say there is no reason why Jews cannot celebrate Valentine's Day, though others might argue that, as a holiday rooted in Christian tradition, it would be a bit peculiar. 
Discover the history of Valentine's Day and its connection to Christianity. Learn why some Jews choose to celebrate the holiday while others prefer Tu B'Av, a Jewish Day of Love. Find out how this alternative celebration has become a Jewish equivalent to Valentine's Day, complete with flowers, romantic dinners, and proposals. 
Tu B'Av is often considered a Jewish version of Valentine's Day. But this ancient holiday has its own distinct traditions and practices, which have evolved until today. Here's what you should know. 
On St. Valentine's Day, 1349, a Shabbat, the entire Jewish community of Strasbourg, in France, was massacred, burned alive in the town square while townspeople watched. Afterwards, townspeople searched the corpses, looking for valuables, and the property of Strasbourg’s Jews was distributed to local Gentiles. 
The amazing Rabbi Mike Uram offers his assessment of whether or not it is problematic for Jews to celebrate Valentine’s Day, so feel free to read his view, or any other that you like. But what I want to say about this is: many Americans Jews (dare I say – the majority) feel the same way I do and like celebrating “Hallmark holidays” like  
For most of this time, the veneration of St. Valentine had nothing to do with romantic love – that was a later addition, begun in 14th century England with a line from English poet Geoffrey Chaucer's Parlement of Foules (1382): “For this was on seynt Volantynys day, Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make” (For it was on Valentine's Day, when every bird comes there to choose its  
From the fourteenth century the focus of Valentine’s Day was romantic love. The Hebrew for love – ahavah – is one of the first words taught to children in the context of the twice-daily recitation of the Shema which demands the Jew “loves God with all one’s heart, one’s soul and one’s might” (Deuteronomy 6:5) . 
If you’ve heard of Tu B’Av, which begins on the evening of August 11 this year, you’ve probably heard that it’s a kind of late-summer Jewish Valentine’s Day. In Israel, it’s become a popular date for weddings and parties, and it’s starting to catch on in the US, too. 
Tu B’Av was almost unnoticed in the Jewish calendar for many centuries but it has been rejuvenated in recent decades, especially in the modern state of Israel. In its modern incarnation it is gradually becoming a Jewish Day of Love, slightly resembling Valentine’s Day in English-speaking countries. 
Before there was JDate and JSwipe, there was Tu B’Av, the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Av, Judaism’s own version of Valentine’s Day. As with many Jewish traditions, its roots are ancient, but it is perfectly adaptable to modern times. 
For additional explanations, see Elon Gilad, “Tu B’Av: The Jewish Valentine’s Day That Came from Prehistory,” in Haaretz (August 30, 2016), accessed May 5, 2017, Tu B’av: The Jewish Valentine’s Day That Came From Prehistory. 2. Ibid. 3. 
Or, how I stopped worrying and learned to love February 14. A Jewish View of Valentine's Day Or, how I stopped worrying and learned to love February 14. 
Do Jewish people celebrate Valentine's Day? Is it Kosher?! Where did the holiday originate, is it Christian in origin with St. Valentine or does it connect t 
Valentine’s Day is no longer celebrated even by Christians as a Christian holiday. It is a day of love, friendship, and candy, each of which is independently explainable,” he added. However, Rabbi Broyde noted, “I think it is the conduct of the pious to avoid explicitly celebrating Valentine’s Day with a Valentine’s day card.” 
The saddest period in the Jewish yearly cycle takes place in the summer months. Beginning with the 17th of Tammuz, which marks the breaching of the Temple walls by the Romans in 70 CE, our tradition calls for increasing mourning, climaxing three weeks later on the 9th of Av (Tishah B’Av), when the Temple was destroyed. 
Before we discuss Tu b’Av, let us first examine why Orthodox Jews do not observe Valentine’s Day. After all, it’s a day dedicated to love – isn’t that a good thing? A Catholic Holiday? For starters, the full name of the holiday is “Saint Valentine’s Day.” You are probably familiar with St. Patrick’s Day. 
For the Jews, the next day was Shabbat. For Strasbourg’s Christian citizens, the next day was February 14, St. Valentine’s Day. They designated this saint’s day as the date on which they would execute Strasbourg’s entire Jewish population. In the morning of Valentine’s Day, a large crowd assembled to watch. </p>
