        <h2><strong>geoffrey chaucer valentines day poem it is valentines day the office</strong></h2>
        <p>If you hate Valentine’s Day, blame 14th century poet Geoffrey Chaucer. While best known for writing “The Canterbury Tales”, Chaucer is also widely credited as the first English writer to associate romantic love with Saint Valentine. 
Chaucer’s Valentine’s Day Poem: The Parlement of Fowles. Legend has it that on Valentine’s Day all birds come together to choose a mate. Geoffrey Chaucer wrote his Dream Poem ‘The Parlement of Fowles’ to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Here is an extract, generously modernised by A.S.Kline: 
The Parliament of Fowls is perhaps the first St. Valentine's Day poem ever written. Brewer suggests that it was begun in May of 1382 and finished for Valentine's day in 1383. The above are lines 183-210 and they have been modernized only enough so that all of the words can be found in a good desk-top English dictionary. 
You know that on Saint Valentine’s day, By my statute and through my governance, You come to choose – and then fly your way – Your mates, as I your desires enhance. But nonetheless my rightful ordinance I may not alter, for all the world to win, That he that is most worthy must begin. 
But Valentine’s Day only became associated with romantic love during the late fourteenth century, when Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343-1400), author of The Canterbury Tales, made the association in his poem ‘The Parlement of Foules’, written some time in the 1380s, possibly in 1382. 
The poem is one of the first references to the idea that St. Valentine's Day was a special day for lovers. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Parliament of Fowls has been passed down in fourteen manuscripts (not including manuscripts that are considered to be lost). Scholars generally agree that the  
The parliament is convened on St. Valentine’s Day - the poem being notable for its early, likely original, association of romance with St. Valentine. Author Details Geoffrey Chaucer was born c1343 in London to a prosperous family of wine-merchants. 
The poem is believed to have been written between 1372 and 1386, and it was likely composed for the occasion of St. Valentine’s Day. Chaucer was known for his use of rhyme royal, a seven-line stanza format that he used extensively in this poem. The poem was first published in 1532, over a century after Chaucer’s death. 
The Parliament of Fowls by Geoffrey Chaucer (ca. 1343-1400) is perhaps the first St. Valentine’s Day poem ever written. The Parliament of Fowls. A garden saw I, full of blossomy boughs Upon a river, in a green mead, There as sweetness evermore enough is, With flowers white, blue, yellow, and red, And cold well-streams, nothing dead, 
In the poem, Chaucer’s narrator describes how several species of birds are called together on Valentine’s Day by the goddess Nature to choose their mates for the year. The full text of the poem (which is, of course, in Middle English) is available here , but we have excerpted a key section of the poem below. 
Geoffrey Chaucer was the first to link the Catholic martyr Valentine with love in his poem Parlement of Foules (1382), written to celebrate the anniversary of the engagement of King Richard II to Anne of Bohemia. In this earliest of valentines, all the birds, the whole parliament of fowls, are gathered in the Garden of Love: 
A poem about birds meeting in February to pick their mates is the first known example of Valentine’s day being  inspired by Chaucer’s poem of love. Wikimedia. In Chaucer’s Parliament of  
Almost nine hundred years after February 14 became Saint Valentine’s Day, Geoffrey Chaucer mentions it in his poem, The Parlement of Foules (Parliament of Fowls/Birds), composed in the 1380s. In the poem, the narrator falls asleep while he searches his books for a “certeyn thing.” 
Did Geoffrey Chaucer invent Valentine’s Day? The answer, as we’ve revealed elsewhere, is, in a way, both ‘yes’ and ‘no’; but this poem, an example of the popular medieval debate poem, certainly helped to popularise the connection between romance or love and the 14 th of February. 
“It is quite possible that in the 14th century Geoffrey Chaucer—best known for his Canterbury Tales—invented our present-day idea of this special day in his dream-vision poem ‘The Parliament of Fowls,’” says Professor Peter Travis. (Illustration by Shutterstock.) 
The earliest known suggestion that Valentine’s Day was a day for lovers comes from Geoffrey Chaucer’s 14th-century poem “The Parliament of Fowls,” in which “Seynt Valentynes day” is the day “whan every foul cometh ther to chese his make” (i.e., in case it’s been a long time since AP English, when birds come to choose their mates). 
The most famous is Geoffrey Chaucer’s reference to Valentine’s Day in The Parliament of Fowls, which depicts birds choosing their mates on the feast day: ‘For this was on Seynt Valentynes day, Whan every foul cometh there to chese his make’ [For this was on Saint Valentine’s Day, when every bird comes to choose his mate, lines 309-10  
Chaucer’s poem from the 1380s, The Parliament of Fowls, is held to be the first reference to February 14 as a day about love. This day was already a feast day of several mysterious early Roman martyred Saint Valentines, but Chaucer described it as a day for people to choose their lovers. He knew that was easier said than done. 
Valentine’s Day may have been invented by medieval poet Geoffrey Chaucer in a poem written around 1375. In the poem, Chaucer refers to February 14 as the day birds come together to find their mate. Medieval symbols like “lovebirds,” “winged cupids,” and “hearts” are still associated with Valentine’s Day. 1 History.com Editors
