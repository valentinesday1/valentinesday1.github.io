Talk to your new crush. One way to alleviate the stress is to simply talk to your crush about it. You can suggest keeping it low-key since you're new to the relationship, as well as make a plan for a nice dinner or an outing if you'd like. 
Roses and chocolates are like soulmate in Valentineâ€™s Day. Valentineâ€™s Day is not a Valentineâ€™s Day if there is no roses and chocolate. Make it more meaningful by giving your crush your own homemade chocolate. Giving them a box of chocolate spelled I LIKE YOU or their name would be great. Love Letter! 
All day we see signs in stores, talking about love, posts online, text from friends, chocolate filled hearts aplenty. It â€˜ s everywhere and, when your boyfriend forgets Valentine â€˜ s Day, the day is horrible. That being said, don â€˜ t forget that the day after Valentine â€˜ s Day is just another day. Another day when life goes on. 
My soon to be LD boyfriend is being moved to a a new base for 3 years (heâ€™s in the military and leaves Feb 4th) he canâ€™t take much with him so I wrote him a letter to take with specifically to be opened on Valentineâ€™s Day and Iâ€™m going to make him his favorite pie the last day before he leaves </p>
