If he's cancelling on you once he's found out it's Valentine's Day, he doesn't sound like much of a stand up guy. This is exactly what I don't get. I'm a guy that doesn't really "do" Valentine's Day, either, but I sure as hell wouldn't let it stop me from going out on a date that I already arranged. 
Our gifting experts curated the 46 best Valentine's Day gifts for him—including cool tech and last-minute picks—in case you're pressed for ideas. 
2.4K votes, 3.4K comments. true. Exactly, I like being romantic and cooking dinner and getting her flowers, I hate having a day where I feel obligated to get gifts and do all of that or go out to a fancy dinner, it's a huge marketing day for cards and heart shaped jewelry and it's bullshit. 
what's more important imo, is to just spend some quality time together. the best valentines day i had was an evening spent cuddled up on the couch after a homecooked dinner. but if you go out to a restaurant or something similar, show him that you really appreciate the effort he put in. all most guys want for valentines is a happy girlfriend  
I’m really struggling this year trying to figure out what to get my husband for Valentine’s Day. Often I try to have something custom made or make something for him that’s sentimental to us and our relationship, but while he’s always nice he doesn’t seem to love it. 
2. Appreciation. Your wife needs to feel appreciated for who she is and what she does. So this Valentine's Day, celebrate her accomplishments. Recognize her talents. 
I think with Valentine's Day its better to lean into their interests. You can make most things related to cheesy romance / Valentine's Day with the right puns or packaging. My husband likes ropes and tying knots. I got him The Ashley Book of Knots, wrapped the book, and tied long lengths of folded paracord into a bow. 
For Valentine's Day I want to come home and have her answer the door dressed in a nice dress (or less) with a "I missed you so much" smile on her face, and we can have a date-night at home :) Reply reply
