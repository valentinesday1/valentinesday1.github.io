        <h2><strong>took a girl out for valentines day stu gotz valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>As for waiting to ask her out, I'm not, I just met her and Valentine's Day is just around the corner, usually I never do anything special for anyone on Valentine's Day for me its just a regular day to watch other people talk about their SOs and give gifts to each other, while I do whatever, so I thought about changing things up a bit. 
I'm a straight girl and I took my female friend out to dinner last Valentine's Day as she was going through a divorce. I came to say that maybe he thought "This girl is sad and lonely and GF doesn't care about this day so it's fine". 
Hi I asked a girl out for valentines day for the first time by text (I would have done face to face but there's like a lot of snow where I am and I have midterms and stuff so I was very busy) but she said that she was thankful that I asked her out but she feels burdened because valentines day is supposed to be with someone special. 
It’s also more my fault than his that we didn’t speak all day. I’ve been dealing with a depressive episode and I slept most of the day yesterday. Like 2-8 and then 830-today. He woke up around 2, we said happy Valentine’s Day to each other then I passed out. He tried to call me around 7 but I didn’t answer because I was sleeping. 
Ok long story short. I’ve been talking to a girl not that long and I asked her out and if she would be free next week. She says yes and now I have to plan the day. Me being me, I forget next week actually is valentines as well. Now I’m thinking the best way to play this because we’ve only really just met. 
This 23-year-old girl and her 29-year-old boyfriend are currently in a long-distance relationship since he's living 4 hours away with his mom as he's about to start a job on the road. Valentine's  
The music and the dance will set the stage for you to ask her out on Valentine’s Day. She will be floored, for sure. 20. With an enticing invitation. Veteran Marriage Therapist Mary K. Cocharo says, “the best way to ask a girl out on Valentine’s Day is by creating an enticing invitation that lets her know that you care enough to make a

Spend the day volunteering for a cause you both care about. 41. Take a paint-and-sip class. 42. Spend the night embroidering (your/their initials, hearts, whatever you’re into) onto each other’s tees, pajamas, or jeans. 43. Do an at-home chocolate and cocktail pairing. 44. Take a food tour of your city’s best dessert spots. 45. Do a puzzle. 
The cost of this performative perfection is staggering. 82% reported feeling burned out from maintaining a flawless facade—what the research identifies as the 'good girl tax.' This chronic self  
First of all, thank you for opening the link! Hello, all. Just to give you a background: I am a senior (21m) in my last semester at college (as is she-21f), and I need advice on asking a girl "to be my valentine" on the 14th. 
Not a holiday like Valentine's day. It's too specific to one person in your life. Most holidays aren't like that. Plus you could unintentionally make the person feel BAD about not having anyone to celebrate that day with. I don't see any good reason to ask unless you like them 
Not necessarily. While it can be sweet to ask her out on a significant date like her birthday or Valentine's Day, you don't have to wait. Sometimes, asking her on an ordinary day can make it even more special because it shows that you couldn't wait any longer. The spontaneity of a random day can actually add to the excitement!

Going out on Valentine’s Day shows that you don’t feel pressured by a day typically reserved for couples in love. Guys are usually impressed with girls willing to go out on that day without making a big deal or attempting to reschedule because it’s the lover’s national holiday. 
i would. i remember asking a girl out in the 3rd grade two days before valentine’s day. then she got weirded out when i brought her flowers on valentine’s day. coming from a 23 year old. but you should ask her out and just buy her a box of sweethearts and give her good fuck on V-Day nothing more. best wishes 
Valentine’s Day is also hard as it normally entails a romantic setting which could put a lot of pressure on her. If you want to show interest you could do something small for her. Like give her a card or some chocolate. 
The Valentine's Day Dilemma Valentine's Day can feel like a make-or-break moment in relationships, especially when you're still in the early stages. You might be wondering, “Is it too soon to ask her to be my Valentine?” or maybe you're looking for the perfect way to ask without it coming across as awkward. It's a delicate balance.

These heart shaped pizzas are a welcome savory treat on Valentine's Day. For more heart shapes, cut tomato into slices, and then cut slices into heart shapes. Do the same to the zucchini and pepperoni. Syd says "we had this pizza for Valentine's Day and it was a great way to get the whole family involved." 
Ask her on a special, one-of-a-kind Valentine’s Day date. “Try to think of unique Valentine’s Day dates, besides just dinner and a movie,” suggests matchmaker and dating coach Courtney Quinlan. “You could go ice skating. You could go on a tour of a brewery or to a winery. You could go on a dog park date. </p>
