        <h2><strong>who had the idea of giving chocolate on valentines day pierchic valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is almost here, but it wasn't always the heart-filled, card-giving, chocolate-gifting holiday we know today. Here's everything you should know about the history of the beloved  
Initially celebrated as a Christian feast day, Valentine’s Day was a secular holiday by 1861, Purinton says, and the temperance movement was beginning in Britain and the U.S. Chocolates became a popular gift, along with flowers and cards, for young lovers, children and adults avoiding the stigma of alcohol. 
Cadbury didn’t trademark his heart-shaped boxes, however, and by the 1930s, other companies — including America’s Russell Stover — had followed suit. Chocolate has been an indispensable part of Valentine’s Day ever since; each year, Americans buy about 36 million heart-shaped boxes of chocolates for the special day. 
A trend is also emerging toward plant-based or vegan chocolate that includes botanicals such as chamomile and lavender. This kinder, more equitable chocolate could make Valentine’s Day even sweeter. 
While the roots of Valentine’s Day go all the way back to Roman times, candy gift-giving is a much more recent development. READ MORE: The History of Chocolate 
Legend has it that Cadbury was the first chocolate manufacturer to present its product in a heart-shaped box back in the 1860s.

Though Valentine’s Day and the link between Saint Valentine and love was first referenced in a poem by Geoffrey Chaucer in the 1382 poem "Parlement of Foules," it wasn’t until the Victorian era when the holiday became commercialized. 
Chaucer’s poem from the 1380s, The Parliament of Fowls, is held to be the first reference to February 14 as a day about love. This day was already a feast day of several mysterious early Roman martyred Saint Valentines, but Chaucer described it as a day for people to choose their lovers. He knew that was easier said than done. 
According to History.com, by the 1840’s the idea of Valentine’s Day becoming a holiday to celebrate love had taken over the English-speaking world.The Victorians from that era loved the idea  
However, our widespread observance of Valentine’s Day did not start until the 1950s when a Japanese chocolate company began promoting the giving of heart-shaped chocolates. This marketing campaign drastically shaped our cultural approach to the holiday.
