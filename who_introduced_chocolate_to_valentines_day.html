        <h2><strong>who introduced chocolate to valentines day first valentines day the office</strong></h2>
        <p>Who Created the First Valentine's Day Box of Chocolates? By the 1840s, the notion of Valentine’s Day as a holiday to celebrate romantic love had taken over most of the English-speaking world. 
Legend has it that Cadbury was the first chocolate manufacturer to present its product in a heart-shaped box back in the 1860s. Laiskonis says, though, that in the U.S. one of the earliest mentions of candy in conjunction with Valentine's Day appears in what he calls a "brief and cynical blurb" from the 1873 Brooklyn Union: "The vulgar valentine is flaunting its polychromatic hideousness in  
Initially celebrated as a Christian feast day, Valentine’s Day was a secular holiday by 1861, Purinton says, and the temperance movement was beginning in Britain and the U.S. Chocolates became a popular gift, along with flowers and cards, for young lovers, children and adults avoiding the stigma of alcohol. 
Fun Facts about Valentine's Day Chocolate. 1. Heartfelt Beginnings: The heart shape has become synonymous with love, and it's no surprise that chocolates follow suit. In the 19th century, Richard Cadbury introduced the first heart-shaped chocolate box, revolutionizing the way we express affection on Valentine's Day. 2. 
During the 1830s, people began celebrating Valentine’s Day with cards, gifts and small tokens of affection – and the imagery of hearts, roses, and Cupid became linked to the occasion.

Cadbury didn’t trademark his heart-shaped boxes, however, and by the 1930s, other companies — including America’s Russell Stover — had followed suit. Chocolate has been an indispensable part of Valentine’s Day ever since; each year, Americans buy about 36 million heart-shaped boxes of chocolates for the special day. 
The connection between chocolate and Valentine’s Day is a fairly recent one by historical standards. Cupids, angels and roses were all part of the romantic vernacular by the 1800s, but it took  
The commercialization of Valentine’s Day flourished in America at the turn of the century. Chocolate pioneer Milton Hershey started as a caramel maker, but in 1894 began covering his caramels  
A few years later — 1868, according to The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets — he introduced the world to the first known heart-shaped box of Valentine’s Day chocolates, although he didn  
Data from the National Retail Federation's 2022 Valentine's Day spending survey showed that Americans spent $23.9 billion on Valentine's Day. The average consumer planned to spend an average $175.41 on the most popular Valentine's Day gifts—candy, greeting cards, and flowers. 
Buying sweets for one's sweetie is a Valentine's Day tradition that dates back well over 100 years. But the romantically-themed candies and chocolates, and how they're packaged, have certainly changed a bit over the years. The first boxes of Valentine's Day candy in the 1890s, for example, were often too pretty for their contents to be eaten. 
The History of Valentine’s Day in Japan. Valentine's Day in Japan has evolved since it was first introduced in the 1950s. Western influence, particularly from the United States, played a crucial role in bringing this romantic holiday to Japan. However, the celebration didn’t take off in quite the same way as in the West. 
And a lot of heart-shaped Valentine’s Day boxes. In fact, according to the NRF, Americans spent $23.9 billion on Valentine’s Day in 2022 and $2.4 billion on chocolates for Valentine’s Day in 2020. That’s a lot of money we can put back into the United States economy if we stick to Valentine’s Day chocolate made in the USA!

Spotting a new market opportunity, the confectionery company Morinaga introduced Valentine’s Day as an American chocolate-giving tradition. Tapping into American culture, they thought it was clever to simply translate English slogans into Japanese. 
While Halloween may boast the largest candy sales of the year in the U.S., Americans spent $1.8 billion on Valentine's Day chocolates in 2023 (via the Chocolate Affairs Magazine). 
While buying chocolates for your valentine now seems like a given, the tradition of gifting chocolates in a heart-shaped box was introduced by Cadbury in 1861. However, the box design wasn't intended for Valentine's Day. It was simply one of several decorative boxes the company introduced to boost sales. </p>
