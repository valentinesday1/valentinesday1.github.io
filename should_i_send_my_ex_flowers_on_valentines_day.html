        <p>So if you send them something on Valentine’s Day, your ex will almost certainly be reassured that they can go do whatever and whoever, take their time, and that there’s nothing for them to worry about because you will just be waiting for them permanently. 
Even if your ex has watched TV shows or movies where the woman was given flowers and your ex thought it was cute, sweet or romantic, it doesn’t mean that she will feel that way when you send her flowers. Remember: TV and movies are not the same as real life. In real life, romance is only enjoyable when the feelings are mutual. 
At the end of the day, whether sending flowers to an ex is a good idea comes down to your specific situation and motivations. Flowers can brighten an ex’s day and show you care if done tactfully. But avoid gestures that could manipulate, confuse, or cause more hurt. If you want to get back together, flowers should be one part of openly  
Should I send ex flowers on Valentine's Day? If you are thinking about sending a gift to your ex on Valentine's Day and are wondering if you should, my expert opinion is that you should not. It will set you back and lower your chances of getting back together with them. V-Day of all days is when your ex should feel the breakup and feel your  
When my friend Barbara got flowers from her ex this past Valentine's Day, she saw red—but not because of the roses he'd sent. She was made furious by what her ex probably thought was a lovely  
11. Should I send flowers to my ex on Valentine's Day? 12. What flower symbolizes regret? 13. What flower means apology? 14. What color flowers say I'm sorry? 15. Is it creepy to send flowers? 16. What does sending flowers to a woman mean? 17. What does sending flowers mean? 18. What flowers mean goodbye? 19. What flowers mean I miss you? 20. 
Should I get my ex a gift this Valentine’s Day? As a general rule, I would say “no”. However it depends on a number of factors, including your intentions, the terms on which you broke up, and whether you’ve kept in contact with your ex. Getting a Valentine’s Day gift for your ex is no small decision. You should contemplate your  
The Perks of a Private Delivery They can send a simple message, like “I'm sorry” or “I love you,” but they can't talk through serious relationship issues or make your “please take me back” pitch for you. You have to be there to express your feelings, and flowers are just helpful to show her that you mean them. 
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
As Valentine’s Day and my lunch with her is approaching, I am wondering if I should send her flowers with a simple message like “just because i miss you xo” for Valentine’s Day. Or if i should just refrain from doing that. I have no idea where her head is at and how she thinks about getting back together now. 
We can't think of a better reason to send flowers than to tell someone you love them, whether it's for a holiday like Valentine's Day or just because. Red roses are always a classic when it comes to expressing your romantic feelings, but the best choice is to go with your special someone's favorite flowers. 
Should I send her flowers on her birthday? What about Valentine’s day – can’t I get my ex something and surprise her? What if I send my ex a gift or something nice anonymously? So let’s dive into some scenarios where it may be a good idea, based on your situation and the timing of things, to actually play your “flower card”. 
You can send flowers. It's perfectly alright to express how you feel through gifts. That's kind of you. On a different note, there seems to be a lack of self-knowledge at play here evidenced by the fact that you think you've "worked" on yourself in three weeks and that you weren't recognizing your failures until the situation spiraled downhill. 
Not on Valentine's day. Depending on the flower she will view you as clingy, obsessive and maybe even a little creepy. She's going to think that you want her back no matter how much you deny it and she's going to get mad because you won't get over her. 
Valentine's Day is a particularly sensitive and emotional day for some people, and even if you and your ex are on great terms, they may need space on a holiday all about romantic feelings.

If you’ve decided not to celebrate with gifts and cards (whether because you haven’t been dating for that long or you just can’t be bothered), at least send a text mentioning the day. You can say ‘happy Valentine’s Day, btw’. Anything. Should I buy my ex flowers? Definitely send flowers if it has been more than a year. 
Anyway, I got flowers delivered to my house on Valentine's Day, with no tag. I figured they were from my ex, since I couldn't think of any other reason they wouldn't have a note or tag on them I am seeing someone else currently, but he doesn't know my address, so I knew they weren't from him. 
E ven though this question has only temporary relevancy because it’s about a certain day of the year, it’s on my list of top 5 questions that I receive about getting an ex back after a breakup. In fact, the question is usually a bit of a two-part one in that I’m usually asked something like, “Should I send my ex a gift for Valentine’s
