On Valentine’s Day in 1929, the American city of Chicago woke up to the news of a gruesome murder where seven men lay sprawled on the cold concrete of a Lincoln Park garage, their bodies riddled with bullets.

A commercial garage on the north side of Chicago was the setting for the most horrific shooting in Mob history, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre.

The Aftermath of the St Valentine’s Day Massacre. No one was ever tried or convicted for the murders of the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Even though most people knew that Al Capone was behind it, they could never connect him to the massacre. For Capone and Moran, this event would be the last time they would ever face-off.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), under the leadership of J.

On this day, one of the most famous Mob Hits of all time took place, the St. Valentines Day Massacre in Chicago, where seven men were shot to death by rival gangsters. What started with the death of Dean O’Banion in 1924 ended on St. Valentines Day in 1929. </p>
