        <p>Some scholars trace Valentine’s Day back to ancient Greece and the mythical green meadows of Arcadia in the Peloponnese. Credit: Public Domain. A modern big business holiday, Valentine’s Day for many means jewelry, flowers, heart-shaped chocolate and candy, and lots of TLC. But it wasn’t always like that. 
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the origins of this festival of candy and cupids are actually dark, bloody — and a bit muddled. Though no one has 
Although there is no evidence linking Saint Valentine’s Day to the rites of the ancient Roman or ancient Greek cults, popular modern sources claim links to the Roman Lupercalia celebration observed around February 13–15, a rite connected to fertility. 
The tale of Eros and Psyche is a modern-day rom-com, filled with a “meet-cute” vibe, drama, forbidden love, and mystery. Their tale transcends time and embodies the true mystical and mythological nature of Valentine’s Day. 
Greek Mythology had a major influence on Valentine's Day from Aphrodite's rose to Eros becoming Cupid. 
There are many theories about where the heart shape originated, but the shape began to gain popularity around the time that Chaucer began to change the perception of St. Valentine’s (which helped make it the Valentine’s Day holiday that we know today). 
Lupercalia: Valentine's Day pagan connections. Lupercalia was a debaucherous festival that celebrated the coming of spring. It included animal sacrifices and drunken revelry to honor Faunus, the  
Where did Valentine’s Day originate? For years, the consensus among historians was that the holiday had something to do with an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia that fell in mid-February. Noel Lenski, a Yale University historian, pointed to the seasonal and thematic connections between Lupercalia and modern Valentine’s Day.

What part does Cupid play on Valentine's Day? Of course, it's not all about St. Valentine. Cupid — the winged baby boy often seen on Valentine's Day cards and paraphernalia — is another symbol of this love-filled holiday, and it's easy to understand why. In Roman mythology, Cupid was the son of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.

What English poet may have invented the specific day Valentine’s Day is celebrated on? Geoffrey Chaucer. 68. How much money is spent each year on Valentine’s Day? $21 Billion . 69. 
Valentine’s Day in Greece is not a big holiday, but each year brings more red and white stuffed bears and heart-shaped candy boxes to Greek shops. Like Halloween in Greece, it’s becoming a bigger holiday each year, at least in the hearts of merchants. 
E very year on Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day is marked by shades of pink, flowers, chocolates, romantic movies and wine — and images of a magical baby boy who flies around shooting arrows at people  
We think of Valentine’s Day as a Christian holiday, but the truth is that the roots for the holiday and many of its symbols were borrowed from the Romans, and they borrowed most of their ideas and stories from the Greeks. Two of the most easily recognized symbols are the heart shape and Cupid. Both of these have their 
The concept of Valentine's as a day for love was helped along not only by Chaucer, but by William Shakespeare, whose use of both Valentine’s Day and Cupid as romantic symbols further bolstered the idea in Britain. Shakespeare also considered Valentine’s Day a day for lovers, and associated Cupid with love. By the 16th century, Valentine’s  
How Valentine’s Day Evolved . 3rd century AD – A priest named Valentine of Rome was martyred on February 14th, 269 AD. Other martyrs named Valentine also existed during that period. 5th century AD – Pope Gelasius I established February 14th as Saint Valentine’s Feast Day to honour these martyrs. 
Where does the name Valentine come from?. The holiday is aptly named after Saint Valentine, but who exactly was he?
