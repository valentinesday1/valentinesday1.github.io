        <p>Q3: Should I wait for a special occasion to ask her out? Not necessarily. While it can be sweet to ask her out on a significant date like her birthday or Valentine's Day, you don't have to wait. Sometimes, asking her on an ordinary day can make it even more special because it shows that you couldn't wait any longer. 
The key takeaway: respecting her need for time might just bring you closer in the long run. We’ll also explore how long you should reasonably wait before re-engaging. What this means for you. When your girlfriend says she needs time, it likely means she wants space to reflect on her feelings for you and her future goals without any added  
Yea, that's all fine. Of course, you're going to have the added benefit of her totally bailing if she's not interested at all. I'd venture to guess most women would not go out on Valentine's Day with a man they have no interest in, even those who have ulterior motives of a platonic night out. 
The music and the dance will set the stage for you to ask her out on Valentine’s Day. She will be floored, for sure. 20. With an enticing invitation. Veteran Marriage Therapist Mary K. Cocharo says, “the best way to ask a girl out on Valentine’s Day is by creating an enticing invitation that lets her know that you care enough to make a

In case, you’ve been meaning to ask a girl out for some time now, Valentine’s Day is the best occasion to do it, since this day, which presents an opportunity to celebrate love  
10 things to consider when she says she needs time . Has she dropped those dreaded words on you? Here are 10 factors to consider when a girl says she needs time to figure things out. 1. Is she feeling insecure? Insecurity is one of the biggest threats to relationships. When your partner feels like their position in your life is threatened, they  
Romantic Ideas for Asking Her Out this Valentine‘s Day So, now it has been quite a while since you are observing her, following her, and perhaps stalking her on Facebook and Instagram. Most often, she shoots a smile at you, tries to strike a conversation, and ends the day by dropping a dry “Goodnight” message. She may be interested, perhaps not. Who knows! But, you must do something  
-Your first date is always a special one. It is your first time out with that special someone and you don’t want to mess anything up. The hardest part about a date is not even choosing the place or what to do on a date but is ask the girl out. You are always nervous about whether she will be happy to come or deny it to your face. 
By the end of this post, you will be much more confident in your approach to asking a woman out that makes her feel more comfortable and excited to say “yes!” The #1 thing you need to do before asking a woman out. When you’re figuring out how to ask a woman out on a date, at least half of the equation is building up the courage to do it! 
4) She’s Scared. A woman may decide to ask for time and space to figure things out when she’s scared – this is all too common, especially in really intense relationships that might have moved too fast or too early for her comfort. 
If Valentine's Day comes around and you know/meet a single girl who you are interested you should say, "we should be Valentines," in a "just for kicks" kinda way. If she agrees then the two of you can casually joke about being Valentines and before you know it you will be flirting like crazy. Play it by ear from there. 
It doesn’t have to be a big deal - “I’d like to take you out on valentine’s day, but we can skip it and leave it for the weekend if you’d prefer” - and she might be wondering what your plans are that night as well. 
i would. i remember asking a girl out in the 3rd grade two days before valentine’s day. then she got weirded out when i brought her flowers on valentine’s day. coming from a 23 year old. but you should ask her out and just buy her a box of sweethearts and give her good fuck on V-Day nothing more. best wishes 
When your girlfriend says she needs time, it likely means she wants space to reflect on her feelings for you and her future goals without any added pressure. It’s important not to take this personally. Her need for time might not have anything to do with you but could stem from something she’s dealing with in her own life. 
Ask her if she’d be your valentine. If she says yes, go ahead with the small gift. If she says no or hesitates let her know that’s no trouble and you still enjoy whatever pace you two are already going. There’s no commitment for her either way - and if she says yes I bet you have a good chance of calling her your girlfriend soon too! 
Ask her on a special, one-of-a-kind Valentine’s Day date. “Try to think of unique Valentine’s Day dates, besides just dinner and a movie,” suggests matchmaker and dating coach Courtney Quinlan. “You could go ice skating. You could go on a tour of a brewery or to a winery. You could go on a dog park date. 
On some level its sweet but asking a girl out for the first time on Valentine's Day can come off a little strong, so if its all in how you pull it off. I would say something like, "I have been thinking about asking you out for some time, but since Valentine's day is coming up I figured I might as well muster the up the courage. 
Asking them at least a week before Valentine’s day will give them time to get excited and to prepare if you’re taking them out on a date on Valentine’s day itself. If you’re already in a relationship, then asking someone to ‘be your Valentine’ is a romantic gesture , signaling that you still love them very much and would like to  
I kinda pussied out, or maybe I wasn't just comfortable with it.. but to not regret it I called her the next day to ask if I could take her out to diner as a late valentine's day diner (thanks justanothernerd), I think she even gave up her night studying for me (found out during diner that she had a presentation and exam the next morning, oops). 
10 things it means when she says “she needs time” 1) She’s on the fence about your relationship. The reason that hearing she needs time is disturbing to a lot of guys is because we all know that it’s usually a bad thing. The most common meaning is that she’s unsure about the future of your relationship. </p>
