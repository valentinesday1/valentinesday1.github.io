Anyways, I‚Äôm not a Valentine‚Äôs Day guy at ALL. I don‚Äôt think she is either. It actually didn‚Äôt cross my mind until I saw the calendar. She‚Äôs very sweet, but also she‚Äôs admitted she needs a lot of time before things went anywhere (first kiss, sex, etc). Fine with me. I‚Äôm mostly wondering - should I get her something? 
Whether the guy is 'supposed to' get his girlfriend anything on Valentine's day is not universally practiced. Likewise on whether or not the girl should get her boyfriend something, though I honestly don't see why not. If girls will expect a Valentine's day gift as well as demand gender equality, it's only fair that the gift-giving goes both ways. 
This will be my 16th Vday with my wife. She has never asked me or gotten me anything (soecial) to celebrate the day. Every year for the last 15 I have gotten her a different rose. 
This could just be me, but my MIL gets upset if my husband doesn‚Äôt give her anything for Valentine‚Äôs Day or carve out time to go see her on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Mind you, she has a husband who showers her in gifts and attention. Growing up, I always thought of Valentine‚Äôs Day as something romantic.

No. Do not get her something for Valentine's Day. Especially a flower. Don't get her a card. If you want to express that you appreciate her friendship, say sometime (not on V-Day!) "Hey I really appreciate our friendship." 
I am a 25-year-old woman and I love men and I love Valentine‚Äôs Day. Here is my advice for you. Get 1 thing that is a traditional romantic gift, and get 1 thing that says something about your girlfriend‚Äôs personality. Or, even better, combine the two. For example, if she loves whales, you could get her candy that‚Äôs shaped like whales. 
I never understood valentines day. Its literally a commercial holiday ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Birthdays are special, anniversaries are specifical*, your chosen religious holidays are special. Valentines day is literally just a day where shops etc can massively jack up their prices. 
Unique Valentine's Day gifts are always a hit, and we think anyone would love one of these. It's a 20-ounce water bottle, Bluetooth speaker, and portable phone charger all in one!
