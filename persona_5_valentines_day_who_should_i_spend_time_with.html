        <h2><strong>persona 5 valentines day who should i spend time with cute happy valentines day meme</strong></h2>
        <p>Oh well, there's always youtube for the Valentine's date scenes anyway. You do, having Finished the game with the full harem ending you get their scene and their chocolate on valentine's and you get Sojiro's chocolate on the next day. I don't know why the hell people insist on posting misinformation after it has been rebutted time and time again. 
For Persona 5 Royal on the PlayStation 4, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "Many questions about Valentine's Day and afterward *spoilers*". 
consquences romance all female confidants: Joker will get beaten on valentine by all girls, meaning Joker will only receive chocolate from Sojiro, including if Joker decided to spend time with Ryuji, all female that joker take on relationship will beat joker on valentine day, additional info if joker romance 2 girls: let's say joker pick girl A on valentine day then joker will beaten up by  
Is there Valentine’s Day in Persona 5? Persona 5 offers some limitations with the dates that Ren can go on. Still, A Magical Valentine’s Day plays devil’s advocate and is broken up into eleven separate chapters where Ren gets to spend some time with every character. Does romance do anything Persona 5? Accepted Answer. 
Choosing to date multiple girls at once will actually net you a bonus scene at the end of Persona 5. On Valentine’s Day, your girlfriend (or girlfriends) will invite you to spend time with them. 
This is inadvisable. While for most of the game, there will be no consequences for doing so, on Valentines Day, you must choose only one girl to spend time with. If you choose not to spend time with any of them, you will be stuck with Ryuji. The following day, 2/15, you will be confronted by whichever girl(s) you scorned. May God have mercy  
Not nearly as tragically as Valentine's Day in p4 did. Holy s*** that was actually dialogue that made you feel like the cheating jackass you were. Hahaha, true, that said, I've not experienced the Valentine's Day Massacre on either game, as VDM is on P4G, and I played vanilla, and on P5, I ended up alone with Ryuji, *clenches fist, and punches  
Subreddit Community for Persona 5 and other P5/Persona products! Please be courteous and mark any and all spoilers. Persona 5 is a role-playing game by ATLUS in which players live out a year in the life of a high school boy who gains the ability to summon facets of his psyche, known as Personas. 
Im 100% sure since you are dating them in the rank 9 confidant thing the game is programed to have them show up on the 15th if you choose to hang with ryuji the day before. since the Vday present is suppose to be a thing for NG+ so i dont think you can skip it if you date one girl and get them to 10 the date will happen the Vday night of the  
Valentine's Day question I just finished my first play-through and dated Makoto (and only Makoto). However, on 13 February I received no text message, and ended up spending Valentine's Day with a lonely Ryuji.

For Persona 5 Royal on the PlayStation 4, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "No Point In Being Loyal (Valentine/White Day Rant)". 
Valentine’s Day Event Respond to the invitation; 2/14 Tuesday: Daytime Weather: Clear. After School. Valentine’s Day Event; Evening Weather: Clear. Evening. Story; 2/15 Wednesday: Daytime Weather: Snow. After School. Spend time with Sojiro Receive “Mercy Chocolate” Evening Weather: ? Evening. Auto; 2/16 Thursday: Daytime Weather  
Towards the end of the trip then u get a choice on who to spend the last evening with. The choices are Makoto, Hifumi (Shogi Player) and Ryuji. My first playthrough, I chose Makoto (although I wish I could have chosen another heroine instead) and she gave me Tiki Keychain which give you +5 MA and +5 EN. 
Persona 5 Royal offers well over a hundred hours of content. Avoid wasting time in this spoiler-free guide! Given a limited amount of time getting to experience all that Persona 5 Royal contains can seem daunting. Rather than getting worried about wasting time this guide will help you settle into your new school life. 
If you want a full romance experience you need to play through the whole game for the school trip/festival (in some, not all cases), Christmas, Valentine's Day and White Day dates. If you just want to get their romances done for the Thieves' Den achievement, you can save scum their rank 9 and 10. 
Who's your pick? I know when I play, I always try to be in a relationship with all the girls, only to reject them all on Valentine's Day and spend time with the bros.

should I keep waiting until I get a few more and tackle them all at once? Yes. I always wait until I have at least three requests. If you have enough SP Adhesives, you can add more. If you want to spend your time as good as possible, do as many requests as possible in one run. 
2. It can. Same thing as before where you could be spending time with one girl and randomly bump into one of your others. Just have to weasel your way out of it. Only happened to me once and I got out of the situation with bonus points for both girls social links The V day scene is just more for comedic purposes. Doesnt really ruin anything. 3. </p>
