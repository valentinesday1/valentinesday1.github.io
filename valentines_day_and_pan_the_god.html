        <h2><strong>valentines day and pan the god valentines day catch me outside</strong></h2>
        <p>The similarities with the half-man, half-animal god Pan are obvious. Semites called Pan “Baal,” a name often mentioned in the Bible. Baal, Bel, Nimrod, Tammuz, Kronos, Pan, Lupercus and Valentine are all one and the same. And Valentine’s Day was the day originally set aside by the pagans in his honor. Engaging in it is simply Baal-worship! 
The god Pan would have influenced the representation of the Devil. The customs of Valentine-s Day come from a Roman festival honoring Pan.  Pan and Valentine-s Day  
THE TRUTH ABOUT ST. VALENTINE'S DAY (What's LOVE got to do with it?) "God is love" 1st John 4:8 To the surprise of many, Valentine's Day isn't an innocent secular holiday; infact the true origins of Valentine's day has it's roots in the occult. Namely in the pagan worship of Baal, the sungod. 
The fortieth day after January 6 - Nimrod’s original birth date - takes us to February 15 th, the celebration of which began on the evening of February 14 th, the Lupercalia or St. Valentine’s Day! On this day in February, Semiramis, the mother of Nimrod, was said to have been purified and to have appeared for the first time in public with  
Nevertheless, Paganism may or may not have had anything to do with Valentine’s Day. Love Birds. How Valentine’s Day became connected with romantic love is said to be due to a poem by Geoffrey Chaucer. In 1375, he wrote “Parliament of Foules” connecting romantic love to the beginning of mating season for birds (mid-February). 
The pagan festival was also in honor of the Roman god Lupercus who was the god of shepherds. Lupercus was Rome's equivalent to the Greek god Pan. The link between the Lupercalia, fertility, and romance in general is evident in the festivities that occurred during the celebrations (Valentine's Day, History Channel web site, retrieved Jan. 10, 2011). 
Pre-Christian origins of Valentine's Day. The obvious fact is that the origins of Valentine's Day predate Christianity. As Myers states: "The most plausible theory for St. Valentine's Day traces its customs back to the Roman Lupercalia, a feast celebrated in February in honor of the pastoral god Lupercus, a Roman version of the Greek god Pan. 
What would God think about Valentine's Day? The World Book Encyclopedia tells us regarding Valentine’s Day: “The customs connected with the day . . . probably come from an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia which took place every February 15. 
The god Pan would have influenced the representation of the Devil. The customs of Valentine-s Day come from a Roman festival honoring Pan. 
There is some indication that the modern holiday of Valentine's Day occupies the place in the calendar which once belonged to the Lupercalia, an ancient festival that took place from February 13th through February 15th. In fact, the name of the month of February descends from a festival called "Februa" that took place on the same dates, a  
Be full in Christ’s love today and on this coming Valentine’s Day. Be encouraged. Grasp how wide and long and high and deep the love of God is for YOU. A love that surpasses knowledge. I don’t know about you, but I don’t think Hallmark will ever come close to expressing love in a Valentine’s Day card the incredible way the Bible does  
In Roquemaure, Southern France, on the Saturday after St. Valentine’s Day, a tradition, begun by Father Rene Durieau in 1989, celebrates the arrival, in 1868, of the relics of St. Valentine. The relics are said to have been be bought in Rome, by a former local, in the hope they would cure the diseased grape vines, (which, within four years  
So in that sense Valentine’s Day is a good day to get drunk. And a good place for some wine tasting is in the Song of Solomon. One read and it isn’t surprising that this wild drinking romp through the vineyard of betrothed (pre-consummated) and marital romantic love makes it one of the most controversial books of the Bible! 
“Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.” – 1 John 4:8 We often think of Valentine’s Day as the day for couples to show their love to one another, but rarely do we use the day to remind us of God’s unmatched love for us, His children.

Feast of Lupercalia . On February 15, Romans celebrated Luperaclia, honoring Faunus, god of fertility. Men would go to a grotto dedicated to Lupercal, the wolf god, located at the foot of Palatine Hill and where Romans believed that the founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, were suckled by a she-wolf. 
St. Valentine’s Day is the world’s “holiday of love.” Since the Bible states that God is love (I John 4:8, 16), does He approve of the celebration of this day? Does He want His people—true Christians—partaking of the candy and cards, or any customs associated with this day? 
Hosting a “Love Your Neighbor” event on a weekend near Valentine’s Day can bring your community together while sharing God’s love. Galatians 5:14 points out: “For the entire law is  
Valentine’s day, also called Saint Valentines Day, is celebrated every February 14. Valentine’s day is when people celebrate love and 
The true origin of Valentine’s Day is outside the Bible and early Christian literature. Christians who may be tempted to compromise need to ask themselves if the origins of Valentine’s Day are biblical or pagan. It is not too hard to figure that out.
