        <h2><strong>valentines day is a pagan satanic holiday images ghost valentines day puns</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is always on February 14th. In 2025, the holiday just so happens to fall on the Friday ahead of a long weekend for most. Monday Feb. 17 is President's Day. Why is Valentine's Day  
The Catholic Church later established St. Valentine's Day after two individuals named Valentine were executed on Feb. 14. This was used as a way to push out pagan rituals which were seen as offensive to the Church. Pope Gelasius I overrode the original ritual, but still held onto the concept of fertility and love.

One might wonder: If the origins of Valentine's Day are tainted with pagan influences, should we then completely reject the day? While this is a valid concern, we must remember that as Christians, we are called to express God's love every day of the year and of our lives, not just on a commercially designated holiday. 
Valentine's Day as a Commercial Holiday . Valentine's Day is no longer part of the official liturgical calendar of any Christian church; it was dropped from the Catholic calendar in 1969. Its not a feast, a celebration, or a memorial of any martyrs. 
The holiday’s origins likely predate the venerated saint. The date of St. Valentine’s execution, the day after the February full moon, might be the real connection with affection. As fans of Shakespeare know, the Idus or “Ides” of each month on the ancient Roman calendar was the day of the full moon. 
The exact history of Valentine's Day is a bit murky, but some historians believe the holiday is linked to Lupercalia, a pagan festival that was held annually between Feb. 13 and Feb. 15 in ancient  
Where did Valentine’s Day originate? For years, the consensus among historians was that the holiday had something to do with an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia that fell in mid-February. Noel Lenski, a Yale University historian, pointed to the seasonal and thematic connections between Lupercalia and modern Valentine’s Day. 
Lupercalia was an ancient pagan festival held each year in Rome on February 15. Although Valentine’s Day shares its name with a martyred Christian saint, some historians believe the holiday is  
On Valentine's Day, millions present flowers, chocolates and cards to their sweethearts.While the holiday's traditions really became cemented in the 1800s, historians link its roots to wild pagan  
Historical Crossroads: Valentine’s Day and Lupercalia. While Valentine’s Day is widely recognized as a celebration of love in modern times, its historical roots are far more intricate and, believe it or not, a bit wilder. The mid-February timing of Valentine’s Day intriguingly aligns with the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia  
History also records that around A.D. 500 Pope Gelasius established St. Valentine’s Day in an attempt to convert this pagan Roman fertility festival into a Christian holiday, thus retaining its attractions and making it easier for pagan people to accept Christianity.

THE TRUTH ABOUT ST. VALENTINE'S DAY (What's LOVE got to do with it?) "God is love" 1st John 4:8 To the surprise of many, Valentine's Day isn't an innocent secular holiday; infact the true origins of Valentine's day has it's roots in the occult. Namely in the pagan worship of Baal, the sungod. 
The Truth Behind St. Valentine’s Day St. Valentine’s Day is the world’s “holiday of love.” Since the Bible states that God is love (I John 4:8, 16), does He approve of the celebration of this day? Does He want His people—true Christians—partaking of the candy and cards, or any customs associated with this day? 
Valentine’s Day’s roots can be traced to the ancient pagan festival known as Lupercalia. It is celebrated on February 15 and is held in honor of Lupercus – their god of husbandry and fertility. Lupercus is also known to be a mighty hunter of various animals, but most importantly, wolves. 
However, Valentine’s Day is not a modern creation. Rather, it is a day with ancient roots, both cultural and religious. With many legends and tales surrounding Valentine’s Day, the supposed day of love, it can be difficult to ascertain exactly where and how Valentine’s Day originated. Pagan Roots of Valentine’s Day. During Roman times  
Valentine’s day, it’s the day when hopeless romantics and lovers send cards, chocolate, and roses to the one they desire. Many see this holiday as fun and innocent, after all, school children across the earth will be sending little cute cards and hard candy that say, “Be mine.” For those who grow up in the Catholic Church, it is a day to remember Saint Valentine, who was killed for
