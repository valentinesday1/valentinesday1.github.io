        <p>When you're tempted to text an ex on Valentine's Day, it's crucial to consider the context of your breakup and current terms. Here’s what to keep in mind. The main way to figure out if it would be 
Should You Text Your Ex on Valentine’s Day? Valentine’s Day can stir up all kinds of emotions. Especially when it comes to an ex. Whether you ended on good terms, still have lingering feelings, or just want to send a friendly message, figuring out what to say can be tricky. I’ve been there. Debating whether to send a text or just let the  
As you can see, there are several ways to respond if your ex contacts you on Valentine’s Day, all depending on the circumstances and your feelings toward them. 
Based on two decades in the relationship-recovery service and thousands of cases, I can tell you that the odds are that the best response you'll get from your ex is a returned, "Happy 
Here are some things to consider before you reach out to an ex on Valentine’s Day. Once and for all, the answer really depends on your current situation and the dynamics of your past relationship. 
Relationship experts discuss why you probably shouldn’t communicate with your ex and self-loving alternatives you can explore during this Valentine’s season. 
In general, it’s not a good idea to send Valentine’s Day messages to an ex as it could be misinterpreted or cause discomfort. It’s important to respect boundaries and move on in a healthy way. Know that you are breaking up for some crucial reasons and know why the two of you cannot get back together. 
Deciding whether to reach out to an ex requires careful consideration of your motivations, the nature of the relationship, and your emotional state. If you do decide to reach out, do so with realistic expectations and an understanding that you cannot control the outcome. You must be prepared to move on either way. 
An expert weighs in on the situations when texting an ex is a good idea (and when it isn't). Plus, find out how long you should wait to text your ex and what to say if your ex texts back. 
What exactly do you hope to gain by reaching out to your ex? How do you hope the conversation will go? Is this going to benefit them? Or will it only benefit you? Could this potentially hurt your ex or make it harder for them to move on? 
However it depends on a number of factors, including your intentions, the terms on which you broke up, and whether you’ve kept in contact with your ex. Getting a Valentine’s Day gift for your ex is no small decision. You should contemplate your relationship history and your goals, before committing to sending them a present. 
Hey there! So after no contact was a success my ex asked to hang out again and we have ONCE and had a good time a few says ago. Now Valentine’s day is tomorrow and she herself mentioned hanging out AFTER the last date/hang out which was only a fee days ago. 
So if you’re wondering whether you should contact your ex on Valentine’s Day and wish your ex the best in his or her romantic life, my advice to you is to find out if you and your ex are ready for Valentine’s Day wishes.

Exactly. And it can be very hard to keep that emotional self control on a day, like Valentine's day, but just remember it's even more important on days, like Valentine's day to continue to no contact and to have that emotional self-control. Craig : Control. Yeah. I think so. I think it's more powerful for your ex not to hear from you. 
1. Just walked by that awful sushi place that I made us go to last Valentine's Day. You were right. I shouldn't trust an influencer's restaurant recs. 
In my post, "Does my ex want me to contact them," and also in my post, "What is my ex thinking during no contact," I explain that there are a few reactions your ex can have to you contacting them in any way. 
Happy Valentine’s Day to my favorite ex! Happy Valentine’s Day! I was going to get you a card, but then I remembered we broke up, so this text will have to do. Let’s take a moment to appreciate how we dodged the expensive couple’s dinner this year. Your wallet is probably grateful. Happy Valentine’s Day! 
Valentine’s Day Wishes for Ex-Boyfriend. Valentine’s Day Messages for Ex-Boyfriend: Send a Valentine’s message to your ex-boyfriend to show him that You are past you two being together and that you wish him the best as he celebrates with his new profound love. Sometimes we love and lose, but we lose for the right reasons. 
The concern is that if you don’t contact your ex with a wish of a “Happy Valentine’s Day,” or, for some, if a gift is not sent, that it will look as though you are neglecting this person and, therefore, pushing them away even more than they are already. </p>
