        <h2><strong>why valentines day is lame valentines day full movie gomovies</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is the one day of the year that you're expected to be better looking, a better lover, a more fascinating conversationalist, the buyer of the perfect gift, and the planner of the  
Here are eight reasons why Valentine's Day is the absolute worst. There's pressure to spend tons of money on cards, gifts, flowers, and candy Showing up empty-handed for a date doesn't seem like  
Valentine's Day is seriously lame. We could start listing all the reasons why it's literally the worst, but why not explain it in GIFs? Keep reading to see why the corporate love trap makes us  
Valentine’s Day isn’t just a gross consumer holiday full of faux-romance and bad candy. It might actually be bad for your heart. 
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the ancient Romans had bloodier, drunker and more naked notions to mark the occasion. 
Don’t fret if you’re spending Valentine’s Day solo. As a date on the calendar, an aisle in the Hallmark store, and a theme for candy makers, our social environment makes us feel like we are  
Valentine's Day is often dismissed as a crass commercialisation of love that allows businesses to cash in on sales of cards, flowers, chocolates, upmarket restaurant bookings, expensive theatre  
For the past six years, my partner and I have tried to do Valentine’s Day “right”: We’ve gone all-in with thoughtful (yet costly) gifts, overpriced dinners booked weeks in advance, and  
People were complaining in women’s magazines in the late 19th century that Valentine’s Day was too commercial. “Everybody’s always expecting Valentine’s Day to die out, and it never does,” she said. “It’s sort of like saying, ‘Coney Island’s too crowded. Nobody goes there anymore.’” 
Cahleb Derry has spent only one Valentine’s Day with a romantic partner, and he has naturally dissociated the holiday from its romantic associations. “I think it’s so important to ‘date  
As a single person, I hated Valentine's Day. I guess I was supposed to mope around because I didn't have someone to give me a bunch of crap I didn't want, and I was even more annoyed by people to did this. I'm married now and I hate Valentine's Day even more. My husband and I aren't into it. We think it's lame. 
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts  
If Valentine’s Day goes poorly, relationships can suffer. Valentine’s Day can also make things worse if you’re already having problems. This is why so many people dread the holiday. #13. Talking about how important (or unimportant) Valentine’s Day is with your partner is good for communication . Feeling the pressure of Valentine’s Day? 
From the very beginning, V-Day was bound to be a bull crap holiday. Even its history is lame and confusing. Take St. Valentine for instance. There were multiple dudes by this name and no one really knows which saint we’re supposed to be celebrating. 
I agree that Valentine’s Day is commercialized and overrated but that’s not what gets me, it’s the people (women I feel like, usually) who get mad at their SOs for forgetting that it’s February 14th and not doing something special for them. If you require extra attention on Valentine’s Day I think that’s lame 
I think Valentine's Day achieved the spirit of Valentine's Day much like Love Actually achieved the spirit of Christmas. Perhaps, but if it's a spirit not worth achieving, that explains the failure. To be honest, Valentine's Day isn't really a highly regarded holiday. It's the job of the film to be honest to reality. 
I'm all for the idea of making Valentine's Day a different day than Feb. 14 though, since on just that specific day, flowers and restaurant prices get jacked up ridiculously, but it would probably be better to give her a heads up that you still intend to have plans. 
It’s a great holiday. I love being able to celebrate the people that I love. Valentine’s Day always feels special, and I have never (until now) been in a relationship during it. A lot of people hate Valentine’s Day because they don’t have a romantic partner, which is dumb because there’s types of love other than romantic.
