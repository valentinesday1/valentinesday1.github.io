        <p>It‚Äôs the expectations that kill it. My parents have always given me v-day candy, so I liked it even though I was single for 21 years of my life, completely single. So it was always a nice something to look forward to. I‚Äôve never been with my husband on valentine‚Äôs day (last year I was traveling to see him on v-day, been together for two  
The even bigger problem: it is far too commercial. Flowers, food, cards and (very) expensive gifts. If you want to do something for Valentine's Day, you are actually expected to spend (a lot of) money. Valentine's Day is no longer about showing your love, but about buying (and for shops: selling) goods. 
Well Valentine's Day is what you make of it. I show my fiance love and respect every single day, but Valentine's is just more of an excuse to indulge on food if anything. Like we don't get each other needlessly expensive flowers or fancy chocolate. I don't even like chocolate, I just get my fiance a chocolate bar from Target.

Watch a cheesy Valentine‚Äôs Day movie on Netflix and take a shot every time they do something clich√©. 16. Pretend you‚Äôre on Top Chef and cook a meal for each other using random ingredients. 17. Make heart-shaped charcuterie boards (heart-chuterie?) to enjoy while you binge-watch something new. 18. 
Cross two off the Live, Love, Laugh list with these funny Valentine's Day memes.  (Source: Reddit) Must Have Been Love (Source: Know Your Meme) Bazinga 
Of the adults who celebrate Valentine's Day, men spend an average of $150 while women usually spend $74;  reddit.com. They make 20‚Äì30% more. 15. So do at-home pregnancy tests. 
1. "When I was a sophomore in college, I met a guy named 'Chris' (that's what we'll call him) at a party. He was tall, handsome, funny, and the president of his fraternity. 
Valentine's Day leaves people in relationships with impossible expectations and leaves single people out. Let's face it: Valentine's Day might actually be the worst. Even if you aren't single on  
Happy Valentine's Day to all who are celebrating! Hopefully, you've found some gems in this list to sweep your partner off their feet. And to those who want to but aren't, there's always next year. As for those who don't want to at all, we've got you covered. Check out our humor desk for some entertaining pieces to keep you company this  
Valentine's Day is stupid and pointless and absurd if you take it too seriously or place too much importance on it. That's where the problem is. Some people put way too much weight on it. There's no reason Valentine's Day can't just be some fun silly holiday that everybody can enjoy. I actually enjoy it more when I'm single! 
This is coming from someone in a relationship I think Valentine‚Äôs Day is stupid. I often find it‚Äôs just an excuse to throw around the word love without any real expectations or for lack of a better word consequences.Truly just a cash grab ‚Äúholiday‚Äù. The mentality that you must prove your love on one specific day seems flawed to me. 
Valentine's day isn't stupid. I actually really like it. When I was little I hated it because I never had a Valentines, but my mom used to always go out of her way to make me feel better. She died when I was a teenager but every Valentine's I remember all the amazing things she did for me. 
The friendlier part of Reddit. Have a fun conversation about anything that is on your mind.  Valentine's day is a stupid marketing ploy. I'm getting married this  
It‚Äôs stupid and overrated. It‚Äôs a terrible holiday that absolutely sucks for people that have never been on a date. I can agree with with this, even if the wording is harsh and I've never really felt this way 
Is sad but u can take the best of the day idk maybe do something 4 u or is the same thing that I do since my ex fiance cheated on me, if u felt lonely that day we can chat and forget that is valentine's day üôÉüôÉ 
For Example: Reading enthusiasts might like a bookmark, a gift card to buy books/manga, book themed snacks, a Valentine's card with funny/romantic quotes/references from a story they enjoy, or a short story about why you love them/your relationship, jewelry/ stationery/ accessories/ novelty socks / whatever they're into that fits into your budget. 
For them, Valentine's Day may be a 'phew, thank God I don't have to deal with this' feeling. (I fit into this one) note: I'm married and very grateful for a partner that legit doesn't care about Valentine's Day - they don't have it in her native country.
