        <h2><strong>what is the story of valentines day st valentines day card friend</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It may have had beginnings in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which celebrated the coming of spring and included fertility rites and other activities, but the origin of the holiday is vague at best. 
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday.  The history of Valentine's Day—and the story of its patron saint—is shrouded in  
These days, Valentine's Day is not just celebrated in the United States, but in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia, too. February 14 is a way millions across the globe  
Bearing cards, flowers, chocolates and poetry, lovers have always swooned on Valentine’s Day as cherubs circled overhead. Right? Or is the history darker, marked by Roman bacchanalia, martyrs and lies? Innumerable legends claim to explain the origins of Valentine’s Day, but as is the case with legends, they leave many questions unanswered. 
The association of Valentine's Day with love and romance can be traced back to the 14th century, particularly through the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Chaucer, in his poem "Parliament of Foules," for the first time linked the tradition of courtly love with the feast of St. Valentine, suggesting that birds chose their mates on this particular day. 
Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, [1] is celebrated annually on February 14. [2] It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine , and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in  
Everyone loves a good love story, but the history of Valentine's Day is a bit different from the romanticized version of the holiday recognized today. While February 14 is widely celebrated with sweet Valentine's Day treats , heartfelt Valentine's Day gifts , and romantic dinners , few people are familiar with the holiday's true origins. 
Where does the name Valentine come from?. The holiday is aptly named after Saint Valentine, but who exactly was he? Valentine is likely based on a combination of two Valentines who were executed on February 14 in different years by Roman Emperor Claudius II in the 3rd century A.C.E., according to NPR. 
Natalia Ganelin/Getty Images. Before the 14th century, St. Valentine's Day was primarily about honoring a Christian martyr. The English poet Geoffrey Chaucer is credited with connecting St. Valentine's Day to the idea of romance. 
N owadays, the premise of Valentine’s Day is simple to understand: Feb. 14 is a time to show appreciation for friends, families, significant others and anyone else you might love. Pinpointing  
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the origins of this festival of candy and cupids are actually dark, bloody — and a bit muddled. 
Valentine's Day has a long and complex history that involves several Christian saints, an ancient Pagan festival, and a dedicated card-maker. Here's the story. 
Historians don’t know much about Valentine’s early life. They pick up Valentine’s story after he began working as a priest. Valentine became famous for marrying couples who were in love but couldn’t get legally married in Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius II, who outlawed weddings. 
Saint Valentine’s Day has also been associated with a Christian effort to replace the older holiday of Lupercalia, which Romans celebrated on February 15. Some modern stories paint Lupercalia as  
The Catholic Church doesn’t recognize St. Valentine’s Day on its calendar anymore, but people throughout the world still celebrate the day. CHANGING TRADITIONS. Valentine’s Day traditions have evolved a lot over the years. For example, in the Middle Ages—which lasted from the 5th to 15th centuries in Europe—people started exchanging  
In this article, we take a look at the various historical and cultural influences that have shaped Valentine’s Day. From the mysterious figure of Saint Valentine and the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia to the medieval traditions of courtly love and the commercialization of the holiday in the modern era, we explore how February 14th became the day to celebrate love. 
Today, Valentine's Day is considered a day of love, but its origin, as discussed above, led to the martyrdom of St. Valentine and is also associated with a pagan festival.
