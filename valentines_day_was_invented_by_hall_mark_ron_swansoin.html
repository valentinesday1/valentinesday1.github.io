        <h2><strong>valentines day was invented by hall mark ron swansoin how to make greeting cards for valentines day for kids</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine’s Day is fast approaching, and it’s often said that the greetings card company Hallmark invented the celebration in a ploy to sell cards. But is this really true? And if not, why do we celebrate romance on the 14th of February and who was Saint Valentine? Saint Valentine. Saint Valentine was a real person. 
Contrary to popular belief, Hallmark did not invent Valentine’s Day. Initially, Hallmark’s founder, J.C. Hall, began selling Valentine’s Day postcards in 1910. As greeting cards gained popularity, Hallmark began printing its very own greeting cards. By 1916, the very first Hallmark Valentine’s Day cards appeared on store shelves. 
Valentines were added to the company’s inventory in 1913. Hallmark began printing its own greeting card designs in 1915. The company’s first Valentine’s Day cards appeared on store shelves in 1916. Hallmark’s first greeting cards in 1915 were printed text and line images made from steel die engravings.

Pope Gelasius I technically invented Valentine’s Day in AD 496 to Christianize the holiday. But the Valentine’s Day we know today, with the cards and chocolates, really started as late as 1985, when Hallmark launched their Valentine’s Day advertisements in the US, claiming themselves as “The Valentine’s Store”. 
The well-known and ever-popular Hallmark card was first introduced in 1910 when Hallmark founder J.C. Hall sold postcards for Valentine's Day. In 1912, the company switched over to greeting cards  
The surprisingly long history of Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day is not a modern, created-by-Hallmark-and-Big-Candy holiday. The first Valentine’s Day was in 496 AD, when Pope Gelasius I  
With advances in printing, the 19th century brought printed Valentine’s Day cards and in 1913, Hallmark Cards printed their first cards, and Valentine’s Day was forever changed. Here are a few cards from 1913 – 1918 available for viewing at the Eagle Historical Society Museum. 
Most people think Valentine's Day was invented by Hallmark Cards. It wasn't. Valentine's Day is actually a well-documented, historical phenomenon -- its tangled roots winding their way through centuries worth of Christian liturgy, pagan tradition, myth, and an occasional beheading. 
The commercialisation of Valentine’s Day. In the mid-19th century the Valentine’s card travelled across the Atlantic. Cards rapidly gained popularity in America, where they were initially advertised as a British fashion. Advanced American technologies meant that more elaborate cards were produced cheaply, encouraging their popularity yet
