        <p>32 Valentine’s wishes for coworkers. When you spend 40-plus hours a week with people, they basically become your work-family. And while Valentine’s Day might not be an official office holiday, it’s still a great excuse to send some appreciation to the people who make your 9-to-5 a little more bearable. 
You are the kind of friend who will never let me feel alone. I’m lucky I have a friend like you to spend my valentine’s day with. Love you buddy! Your presence in my life is like a warm hug, and I look forward to creating more wonderful memories together. May it be filled with good vibes, great company, and maybe a little chocolate too! 
Valentine's Day may not seem like the single best day for you if you are single. But, there are more than a couple of things that you can do on February 14. In fact, here are 14. 
Valentine’s Day brings out the romantic—or impulsive—side in all of us. For some, it’s the perfect excuse to send that heartfelt text you’ve been debating for weeks, the one that you hope will rekindle an old romance or at least give you some closure. For others, the pressure of the day might lead to sending something let’s just say, regrettable. 
Happy Valentine’s Day, my beautiful wife! May your Valentine’s day be blessed with the heartiest of wishes and a mountain full of love. Dear Wife, thanks for being part of my life and making it so much better than it ever was. Lots of love on this Valentine’s Day! You are the angel that came down from heaven to make one’s life beautiful.

Shopping with friends is always fun for me, even when I don’t buy anything. If you’re on a budget this Valentine’s, try your local thrift stores. 
1. Every day with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from.” Happy Valentine’s Day, baby! 2. You are my best friend, my partner in everything, and the love I never thought I deserved. 3. You make every day feel like Valentine’s Day just by being you, I’m so lucky to call you mine, today and always.” 
Set up a wine-tasting station with bottles that tell your story — think the Montepulciano you had on your first date — trading sweet (or funny) memories as you sip. 20. DIY V-Day chocolates (great news: You can skip the gross orange ones). 21. Hire a personal chef to come over and make you dinner while you cuddle on the couch. 22. 
Love it or hate it, February 14 is right around the corner. You’re gonna want to have Valentine’s Day activities or plans that excite you, regardless of how you feel about the holiday or your  
Happy Valentine’s Day! Thanks for being my person. To the person who makes me the best version of myself. Happy V-Day to the person who would help me hide a body.

Not a holiday like Valentine's day. It's too specific to one person in your life. Most holidays aren't like that. Plus you could unintentionally make the person feel BAD about not having anyone to celebrate that day with. 
1. Every day with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from.” Happy Valentine’s Day, baby! 2. You are my best friend, my partner in everything, and the love I never thought I deserved. 3. You make every day feel like Valentine’s Day just by being you, I’m so lucky to call you mine, today and always.” 
The only thing is the stuff I've seen about a guy missing Valentine's day with his girlfriend is a red flag, and I realized it was kinda off that he forgot and planned a day out where he couldn't text me specifically on Valentine's and leading into the next day where he might not be home either 
You should not have asked her to break her other plans. She's probably been leaning on her friends hard for support during your breakup, they made what sounds like a really nice plan to spend a potentially difficult evening together, and it would be crappy of your girlfriend to suddenly ditch them because you two decided yesterday to "start to" get back together. 
Whether attending with a loved one or celebrating solo, this event is the perfect way to mark the season of love. Tickets are now available via Dial *714*1010#, so don’t miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
Should have ONLY done it because you wanted to. You shouldn’t spend the last of your money on a joke of a holiday. The end of the day you got upset over thing you built up in your head. For Valentine’s Day my wife and I spam each other with the cheesiest and most messed up valentines memes we can find. That’s it. That’s all. 
That was me until I was 27. I met my wife the Valentine’s Day after. We have a lovely daughter and a baby boy in his way (any day now!). Valentine’s Day doesn’t mean anything, hun. Don’t get caught up in the Hallmark holidays 
Wishing you the best Valentine’s Day. Thank you for being there. Happy Valentine’s Day, my guardian angel. Here’s a huge hug and a bundle of kisses. Thank you for taking care of me always. Out of all people who matter to me, you are the one who gets me completely. Happy Valentine’s Day, BFF! Hope your Valentine’s Day is full of hugs  
My mind is tell me yes, and my heart is telling me yes. If you've only been on three to six dates with someone, it's a little early for Valentine's Day celebrations. Then again, I am a sheepish  </p>
