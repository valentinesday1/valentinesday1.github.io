What to do if your Valentine’s Day request is rejected?

2. Get Dressed up for a Photo Session. Pick a pretty, romantic location and ask a friend with a decent camera to play photographer. Get photo ready with dazzling makeup and a gorgeous dress, and have him wear something nice and dressy. 
With a Flirty Text: If you're feeling bold, send her a playful and flirty text that teases your Valentine's request. Keep it light and fun!

Box of chocolate crickets. Then tell her these faux (pronounced "foe") forced shows of affection bug you. You'd like to give her something real, because she's real to you. The only real thing in all of this. I suggest you put your fingers up her nose and lick her across the face at this point, or psshbe boring and simply kiss her.
