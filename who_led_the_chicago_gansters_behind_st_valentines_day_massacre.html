        <p>The St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the intended album title for rapper 50 Cent's second studio album. It was later retitled The Massacre, due to date pushbacks. The album was released on March 3, 2005. [18] Grand Theft Auto Online featured an update titled the Valentine's Day Massacre Special. The update released on February 14, 2014. [19] 
On Valentine’s Day in 1929, the American city of Chicago woke up to the news of a gruesome murder where seven men lay sprawled on the cold concrete of a Lincoln Park garage, their bodies riddled with bullets. According to reports, the killers were possibly police officers who had tricked their victims into believing they faced a routine arrest. However, it soon became apparent that it was  
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre shocked the world on February 14, 1929, when Chicago’s North Side erupted in gang violence. Seven men associated with the Irish gangster George “Bugs  
Reenactment of the St. Valentines Day massacre. Chicago History Museum The Leadup to the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre: Al Capone and George “Bugs” Moran. Rivalry was part and parcel of bootlegging life in 1920s Chicago. It wasn’t strange for arguments and feuds to be settled with gun battles or covert assassinations, but what occurred  
George “Bugs” Moran was a career criminal who ran the North Side gang in Chicago during the bootlegging era of the 1920s.  The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre actually proved to be the last  
What is now a parking lot adjacent to a senior living center on Clark Street in Lincoln Park was once the location of a shocking, violent event at the height of Chicago’s gangland wars of the 1920s. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre marked a critical point in the Beer Wars, a years-long conflict between Chicago’s gangs who were battling for control of the bootlegging market and organized  
As the culmination of a gang war between famous rivals Al ‘Scarface’ Capone and George ‘Bugs’ Moran, the bloody events of the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre were splashed across the world’s media and came to symbolise the violence of the prohibition era in Chicago. Chicago was the crime capital of America 
The actual massacre is also dramatized in Roger Corman‘s 1967 film The St. Valentine‘s Day Massacre. From The Untouchables to Boardwalk Empire , Peaky Blinders to The Simpsons , the specter of Al Capone‘s Chicago and the St. Valentine‘s Day Massacre continues to loom large as a symbol of the Prohibition era‘s lawlessness, corruption  
The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre is the name given to the shooting of seven people (six of them gangsters) as part of a Prohibition Era conflict between two powerful criminal gangs in Chicago, Illinois, in the winter of 1929: The South Side Italian gang led by Al "Scarface" Capone and the North Side Irish/German gang led by George "Bugs" Moran. 
The ongoing rivalry between the South Side Chicago’s Italian gang led by Al “Scarface” Capone and the North Side Chicago’s Irish gang led by George “Bugs” Moran ended with the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre – the murder of seven gang members from Moran’s gang. 
A commercial garage on the north side of Chicago was the setting for the most horrific shooting in Mob history, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. On February 14, 1929, seven members and associates of George “Bugs” Moran’s bootlegging gang were lined up against a wall and shot dead inside the garage at 2122 North Clark Street. 
THE COLDEST CASE: Since February 14, 1929, when seven men were gunned down inside a Clark Street garage, the mastermind behind the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre has remained a mystery, though  
During Prohibition, Al Capone controlled Chicago’s underworld. Dozens of murders were attributed to Capone and his gang, including the St. Valentine’s Day massacre in 1929. (Chicago Tribune  
At 10:30 on the morning of February 14, 1929, seven members of Chicago's North Side Gang were lined up against a wall inside one of their leader's bootlegging garages and gunned down in a barrage of bullets by men dressed in trench coats and police uniforms, leaving a scene of carnage that to this day is referred to as the bloodiest day in mob  
Chicago Tribune, February 15, 1929. In the state’s attorney’s investigation last night of the “north side massacre” in which seven men were shot dead against a wall in a garage at 2122 N. Clark street yesterday morning a dovetailing of underworld rumors developed a double motive. 
Upon his death, Gusenberg became the final victim of a highly orchestrated crime, Chicago’s most infamous mob hit, which would come to be known as the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. The massacre had been carefully planned and executed by notorious mobster Al Capone, to eliminate a rival gang boss, George “Bugs” Moran. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre was violent and shocking in a way that had become Capone’s trademark — and this put significant pressure on officials to crack down on gang activity in Chicago. In many ways, the massacre marked the beginning of the end of a certain wild west period in the underworld of Chicago, even the country as a whole. 
Around 10:30 a.m. on St. Valentine's Day, February 14, 1929, seven members of Bugs Moran's gang were gunned down in cold blood in a garage in Chicago. 
Known as the bloodiest day in mob history, the 14th February 1929 will forever be known as the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Seven members of the North Side Irish gang and their mechanic were lined up against the inside wall of the garage at 2212 North Clark Street, Chicago and murdered by four still unconfirmed perpetrators. 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre of 1929 – a mystery still unsolved – is the story of seven men, gunned down in a Chicago warehouse. The Mob Museum tells this story, brick by brick, bullet by bullet, on its website dedicated entirely to the Massacre: stvalentinemassacre.com. </p>
