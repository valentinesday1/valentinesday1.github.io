        <p>At 10:30 in the morning on Saint Valentine's Day, Thursday, February 14, 1929, seven men were murdered at the garage at 2122 North Clark Street, [2][3] in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago's North Side. They were shot by four men using weapons that included two Thompson submachine guns. 
The most notorious case was an event that became known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. At half-past ten on 14th February, 1929, six members of the Bugs Moran gang were sitting in a garage waiting for a consignment of illegal alcohol. 
Planned by McGurn and members of the Circus gang, imported hired killers are sent in the Moran warehouse to kill George "Bugs"Moran. Moran is a rival and thorn in Capone's side. Moran and his gang have posession of the lucreative Northside booze business and other rackets. 
THE COLDEST CASE: Since February 14, 1929, when seven men were gunned down inside a Clark Street garage, the mastermind behind the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre has remained a mystery, though  
The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre is the name given to the 1929 murder of seven men of the North Side Irish gang during the Prohibition Era.[1] It resulted from the struggle – between the Irish American gang and the South Side Italian gang led by Al Capone – to take control of organized crime in Chicago.[2] 
Chicago’s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine’s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone’s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George “Bugs” Moran, ran his 
Valentine's Day 1929 marks the most infamous gangster mass murder in history, when mobsters Al Capone, "Bugs" Moran, and others fought for their share of the profits from illegal activity in 
Of all the violence that the city saw under Capone's reign, however, nothing shocked the public as much as the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929. On February 14th, Capone’s henchmen, disguised as police, had lined up and killed seven members of the opposing Moran gang. 
PRIMARY SOURCE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE. See primary source image. SIGNIFICANCE. The St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the climax of Chicago's gangster era, cemented Al Capone's control of the city's bootlegging and vice operations. No one doubted that Capone had ordered the executions. 
Seven members of the North Side Irish gang and their mechanic were lined up against the inside wall of the garage at 2212 North Clark Street, Chicago and murdered by four still unconfirmed perpetrators. 
For more information on Al Capone, check out the FBI’s website. There you’ll find 107 pages of investigative files related to the St. Valentine’s Day assacre. You’ll also be able to see Capone’s mug shot from Alcatraz (pictured at left), his fingerprint card and criminal record.

The negotiations for the St Valentine’s Day massacre were carried on in a suite of rooms in a hotel not far from Michigan avenue and Congress street. Al Capone made it a point to be out of town.

St. Valentine’s Day Massacre Evidence. On the chilly winter morning of February 14, 1929, four men entered SMC Cartage Company garage in Chicago. Seven members of Bugs Moran’s gang were lined up against the wall and shot. The men opened fire with two Thompson submachine guns and a shotgun. All seven were shot dead. 
Al Capone’s Chicago Outfit was widely suspected of ordering the hit, but no one was ever prosecuted.
