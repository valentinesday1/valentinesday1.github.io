Valentine’s Day is filled with fun traditions, including decorating with paper hearts, trying heart-shaped food recipes, coloring everything red and pink,

Valentine’s Day is generally connected with love and passion, but it also has a more spiritual connotation.

The day before Valentine’s Day, thoughts are racing through my mind as I fall asleep. Do I have everything ready? I wonder if I have enough flowers and chocolate to give out. I hope this year will be better than last. I wake up the next day feeling energetic because it’s my favorite day of the year: Valentine’s Day. 
Since Valentine’s Day is upon us next week, I’ve been thinking a lot about early childhood memories and how they influence how we celebrate today.

“If you had waited another day, you may not be awake right now” a doctor told me. After all of that, my hatred for Valentine’s Day reached an all time high. Going into Valentine’s Day 2023, I was miserable. Leading up to Valentine’s Day, I would have nightmares, seeing myself in that same hospital bed I was in just a year ago.
