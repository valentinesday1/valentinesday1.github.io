        <p>Cadbury didn’t trademark his heart-shaped boxes, however, and by the 1930s, other companies — including America’s Russell Stover — had followed suit. Chocolate has been an indispensable part of Valentine’s Day ever since; each year, Americans buy about 36 million heart-shaped boxes of chocolates for the special day. 
Stories of chocolate's effects in the bedroom persisted nonetheless, which might explain why candy-sellers embraced the sweet treats when Valentine's Day became popular. 
Wrapping up. Although chocolate is suitable as a gift for practically any occasion, it’s Valentine’s Day when it truly comes to the fore. It’s a holiday chocolate gift that will be loved, treasured, enjoyed, and cherished by your loved one as the memory will linger with them for years to come. 
Who Created the First Valentine's Day Box of Chocolates? By the 1840s, the notion of Valentine’s Day as a holiday to celebrate romantic love had taken over most of the English-speaking world. 
In the late 19th century, Cadbury, already a successful chocolate manufacturer, began producing special chocolate products specifically designed for Valentine’s Day. Recognizing the cultural association between chocolate and romance, Cadbury sought to capture the Valentine’s Day market by offering chocolates in fancy boxes that could be  
Legend has it that Cadbury was the first chocolate manufacturer to present its product in a heart-shaped box back in the 1860s. Laiskonis says, though, that in the U.S. one of the earliest mentions of candy in conjunction with Valentine's Day appears in what he calls a "brief and cynical blurb" from the 1873 Brooklyn Union: "The vulgar valentine is flaunting its polychromatic hideousness in  
The link between chocolate and Valentine's Day becomes clearer with an understanding of the holiday's origins.

St. 
Initially celebrated as a Christian feast day, Valentine’s Day was a secular holiday by 1861, Purinton says, and the temperance movement was beginning in Britain and the U.S. Chocolates became a popular gift, along with flowers and cards, for young lovers, children and adults avoiding the stigma of alcohol. 
Valentine's Day falls on February 14—a day when lovers show their appreciation for each other, through romantic poems, letters, cards, chocolates, roses, or other gifts. The holiday dates back  
For Valentine's Day in Japan and South Korea, many women give chocolate to all the men in their lives, whether the relationship is romantic or platonic. (Their turn to receive chocolate comes a month later on March 14). In Ghana, February 14 is National Chocolate Day, a day to promote and celebrate one of the country's top exports. 
White Day, celebrated on March 14th, is a day when men are expected to return the favour to women who gave them chocolates on Valentine’s Day. The gifts given on White Day are often more expensive and can include jewellery, white chocolate, marshmallows, and cookies. 
Valentine’s Day is a celebration of love, romance, and meaningful gestures, but have you ever wondered how it all began? Or why chocolate has become the ultimate symbol of affection? Let’s dive into the fascinating history of Valentine’s Day and explore how chocolate came to dominate the holiday of love.

4. Cupid has roots in Greek mythology. Watch out around Valentine’s Day, or else you may be struck by Cupid’s arrow. According to Ti me, the ubiquitous cherub can be traced back to 700 B.C.In

New Year’s Day is followed by Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day and Easter — a celebration for every month, but there weren’t any holidays in Japan then. So Japanese manufacturers saw one thing: an opening, a gap — and business potential. 
Honmei Choco is the cream of the crop when it comes to Japanese Valentine’s Day chocolate–the type that Japanese women give only to the man they really love. Honmei means “one’s heart desire”, and this chocolate, perhaps, has the closest meaning to Valentine’s Day chocolate we know in the West.
