        <p>Galentine’s Day is observed every year on February 13, the day before Valentine’s Day, as a way for women to commemorate female friendships. 
The Tuesday before Valentine’s Day, known as “Red Tuesday,” is the most common 24-hour period for break-ups, according to experts, who say the looming holiday prompts people to reassess  
Valentine's Day isn’t just for new couples or hopeful romantics—it’s for everyone, including those who have been together for years, even decades. Many people look for creative and romantic ways to spend Valentine's Day, making it a memorable occasion for their loved ones. Whether you’re crushing on someone, dating, engaged, or married, asking, “Will you be my Valentine?” is a  
If you're unfamiliar with Galentine's Day, here's the scoop: The holiday takes place on February 13, the day before Valentine's Day. It all started back in 2010 when Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) invented the special day for her and her girlfriends on the popular TV show Parks and Recreation. 
Valentine’s Day 2025 will fall on Friday, Feb. 14. What is Palentine's Day? Palentine's Day is a celebration of friendship that grew out of the success of Galentine's Day to include everybody. 
When to ask someone to be your Valentine will depend on your age and your relationship with the person you want to ask. Tweens and teens often want to ask someone they have a crush on to be their Valentine in school. The best time to ask someone is a week before Valentine’s Day or early February. This way, you can ask them before anyone else does. 
Instead, plan your first date to take place either before or after the holiday. If you get together before Feb. 14 and absolutely hit it off, then you can think about seeing each other again on 
I've been going on dates with this girl for almost a month now. We really like each other and recently I asked her to be my valentine's which she said yes to. But now I'm not sure when the appropriate time would be to ask her to officially be my girlfriend. 
If you’re planning to end your relationship, there are benefits to breaking up before Valentine’s Day. But if you’re not sure, breaking up after the holiday might help you sort through your 
Galentine's Day is a holiday Amy Poehler's Parks and Rec character Leslie Knope created that occurs every year on Feb. 13, the day before Valentine's Day. As Leslie herself explains on the 
I (late 40s) just started dating a girl (44) and we are hitting it off fairly well. Been on 3 dates. Date 4 is this weekend. I'm not a fan of Hallmark holidays but I feel like I should do a little something for Valentine's. 
Or reaching out. Wishing them a Happy Valentines Day. Holidays like Valentines Day are scary as hell because you put a tremendous amount of pressure on that day and knowing how to handle it. There are a lot of break ups around Valentines Day so I know there will be a lot of new people who discover my work because of it. 
Those of you in unsatisfying relationships are probably ready to smash your computer if you hear one more mention of Valentine's Day (sorry). Well, I've got some news that could perk you up a bit  
Also, Valentine's Day is one of the worst days to go out for a date. Restaurants are packed, which means the food isn't usually as good, the servers are cranky, and the restaurant is noisy. Reply reply 
i would. i remember asking a girl out in the 3rd grade two days before valentine’s day. then she got weirded out when i brought her flowers on valentine’s day. coming from a 23 year old. but you should ask her out and just buy her a box of sweethearts and give her good fuck on V-Day nothing more. best wishes 
Another fair question is whether she wants to do anything actually on Valentine's Day. It's on a weekday this year and it's a major date holiday, so restaurants and movie theaters are going to be packed and you're not necessarily going to want to stay out all night. 
You might consider asking her out before valentine's day (sans flowers) for something more low key but romantic. It will be much less pressure than doing something on Valentine's day and it if it goes well you can really go all out for Valentine's day. Just ask her over the phone or in person if she would like to go to dinner with you. Not lunch. 
To be fair though, they probably are. Fuck going out to eat on Valentine's day. Or any major "go out to dinner" holiday. It's not happening. AT ALL. I will, however, cook a large, romantic dinner and romance the hell out of the night, but I will never go out on Valentines day. 
Ah, Valentine&amp;#39;s Day. A holiday that wouldn&amp;#39;t be complete without candy hearts, rom-com movie marathons, sappy Instagram posts, plush animals, bouquets of roses and our personal favorite: endless amounts of chocolate. With so much *love* in the air, it&amp;#39;s normal 
So I’ve been on 2 dates with this girl. I like her. We text a lot also. We’ll probably have a third date on Saturday. We don’t know each other super well yet, but I think if the next few dates go well I’d ask her to be my girlfriend. Anyways, I’m not a Valentine’s Day guy at ALL. I don’t think she is either. </p>
