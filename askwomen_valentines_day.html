        <p>My bf of 3 years thinks Valentine’s Day is dumb because “we love each other every day”. I told him I love the romance and it’s just a day to something a little more special. My bf is not romantic at all. I asked him to plan something for Valentine’s Day and gave him a bunch of ideas. I told him I’d love flowers too. 
Do you see Valentine’s Day as only/ mainly about romantic love, or any type of love? I’ve seen a lot of valentines wishes just in friend of family group chats or directly, galentines celebrations are very popular, families sometimes do something for the kids etc Maybe everyone just likes hearts and the color red 
Since our Xmas mega thread was so successful, we're bringing the idea back for Valentine's Day, the day before everybody's favorite holiday: Half Price Chocolate Day. We'll be posting a link to this thread at the top of the subreddit and in the sidebar, as well as closing and redirecting all individual posts related to V-Day gift ideas here.

Millions of couples will celebrate Valentine's Day this week with carefully orchestrated dinners, meticulously chosen gifts, and perfectly staged photos. But new research reveals what women really  
4. Cupid has roots in Greek mythology. Watch out around Valentine’s Day, or else you may be struck by Cupid’s arrow. According to Ti me, the ubiquitous cherub can be traced back to 700 B.C.In

Happy Valentine’s Day! Thanks for being my person. To the person who makes me the best version of myself. Happy V-Day to the person who would help me hide a body. 
According to a survey from Wedding Wire, Valentine's Day was the most popular day in 2020. This matches up with plenty of other surveys which have found that February 14 Christmas, and New Year's are all dates that people love to pop the question. 
What's the Valentine's Day happy medium? Readers, we're on a mission to find out. We're hosting a special live edition of our AskWomen series via a Google Hangout on February 8th 
To them Valentine's Day is kind of like a massive Love day and everyone gets eachother cards (parents give me cards, grandparents get me cards, etc. etc  
This year is the first in 5 we're actually celebrating V-day (I'm not a huge fan) but he came up with a plan I couldn't resist, apparently unbeknownst to me there are some haunted houses running that night with Valentine's day themes (think death to all things cuddly) for the first time in my life I'm actually a little excited about all the  
As valentines day is more of a friends day in Finland, I was going bake some carrot cake or some brownies and maybe a handwritten card etc. not super all out (broke student lol) for a girl (space) friend for tomorrow as she got me some chocolates and a card for christmas. 
For me, Valentine’s Day is fun for kids to give each other little cards and candy in decorated shoeboxes, but all the adult stuff is tacky and trite. I’ll take some of those weird chalky heart candies though. 
The Valentine's Day before last my boyfriend (then just a guy I was casually seeing) worked from noon until midnight every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. Valentine's Day was on a Saturday so on the 13th (Friday) he nonchalantly asked if I'd like to come over after he got off work that night - he would usually get home at about 12:10 am. 
The first Valentine's Day I ever spent with my partner, following 4 years of long distance. He shows me everyday that choosing to take a risk and do the distance was worth it. I felt so fulfilled, happy and loved that Valentines day. Plus he has a gift for cooking incredible food and finding the best chocolate shops. What a Valentine's day. 
And that is fine with me. V Day has always been a day to be happy and share treats and cards with friends. Not a day to be sad in the years I didn't have an S/O. There will be plenty going on in town all day, party with the neighbors and a piñata for kids at night. 
For people who don’t know, Galentine’s Day is a holiday made up by Leslie Knope from Parks &amp; Rec. It’s the day before Valentine’s Day and it’s meant to celebrate your female friendships. It’s totally a Leslie thing to do, but so many people liked the idea that now it’s kind of becoming a thing. I like it. 
My then boyfriend woke up on Valentine's Day and said, "Let's get married today." We had been mulling and agonising how we were going to get married because my father had died two months earlier in London, my family was 5,000 miles away and every wedding scenario I could imagine was fraught with hurt feelings and huge amounts of money being spent and people still being angry.
