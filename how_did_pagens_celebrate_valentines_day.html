        <p>Valentine's Day is always on February 14th. In 2025, the holiday just so happens to fall on the Friday ahead of a long weekend for most. Monday Feb. 17 is President's Day. Why is Valentine's Day  
Valentine's Day as a Commercial Holiday . Valentine's Day is no longer part of the official liturgical calendar of any Christian church; it was dropped from the Catholic calendar in 1969. Its not a feast, a celebration, or a memorial of any martyrs. 
In the late 5th century A.D., Pope Gelasius I eliminated the pagan celebration of Lupercalia and declared February 14 a day to celebrate the martyrdom of Saint Valentine instead, although it’s  
Every year on February 14, the world marks Valentine’s Day. Millions send messages and gifts of love to the people most important in their lives. You’d be forgiven for thinking the fourteenth has its roots in the Christian faith, with the day seemingly named after Saint Valentine, a priest who lived during the third century AD. 
Americans are projected to spend $25.8 billion on Valentine’s Day this year, according to the National Retail Federation. More than half of consumers plan to celebrate and will spend an average  
Why Valentine’s Day is Pagan. Hello, busy Pagans! If you’re pondering why Valentine’s Day might feel more ancient and mysterious than a simple celebration of love, here’s a quick answer: Valentine’s Day has roots in the pagan festival of Lupercalia, a Roman event blending romance, fertility, and some quirky traditions. 
When Valentine's Day looms on the horizon, many people start thinking about love. Did you know that the modern Valentine's Day, although named for a martyred saint, actually has its roots in an early Pagan custom? Let's take a look at how Valentine's Day evolved from a Roman festival into the marketing behemoth that it is today. 
Valentine's Day occurs on February 14 and, according to History, the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia took place on February 15 each year as a means of warding off evil spirits and promoting fertility. Lupercalia did involve love, of a sort, and here "love" actually means "random sex" — specifically, that part of the festival, (which also  
On Valentine's Day, millions present flowers, chocolates and cards to their sweethearts. While the holiday's traditions really became cemented in the 1800s, historians link its roots to wild pagan  
People were complaining in women’s magazines in the late 19th century that Valentine’s Day was too commercial. “Everybody’s always expecting Valentine’s Day to die out, and it never does,” she said. “It’s sort of like saying, ‘Coney Island’s too crowded. Nobody goes there anymore.’” 
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts  
Therefore, if you don’t want to celebrate the pagan Valentine’s Day with love-making and feasting, make it a day of cleansing and purging. Get rid of what no longer serves you in the physical. Including clutter in your space (think junky closets, pantries, fridge, etc.) and then cleanse the negative vibrations via smoke-cleansing . 
Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the ancient Romans had bloodier, drunker and more naked notions to mark the occasion. 
Valentine's Day history: From pagan origins to endless promotions, with a little love The origins of Valentine's Day remain shrouded in mystery, though some theories have grown to be widely  
Valentine's Day has quite the history. Learn about why we celebrate Valentine's Day, the meaning of the holiday, when Valentine's Day is this year, why Valentine's Day is on February 14, and more. 
If you’ve heard of Lupercalia, the ancient Roman festival and pagan holiday that took place on February 15, you’ve most likely heard that it’s a precursor to Valentine’s Day. And, while that it’s own story, the February festival of fertility and purification is interesting enough to learn about on its own. 
It’s often speculated that Valentine’s Day has its roots in the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia, and it’s not hard to see why. Lupercalia was observed on February 15, and involved fertility rituals — albeit along with animal sacrifice and ritual whipping. Yet the link between this pagan festival and the Christian feast day that morphed into our modern ode to love and romance is  
Valentine’s Day is big business. Candy sales on this day account for about 4 percent of total yearly candy revenue. It is the busiest holiday for fresh flower sales, accounting for 40 percent of annual revenue. This has powerful repercussions on the economy. In the United States alone, this one day of sales added about $18.6 billion to the  
Valentine's Day Today: A Soft Echo of Pagan Roots We see Valentine's Day as a time for sentimental notes, plush teddy bears, and sweet tokens of love. We wear pink or red sweaters and expect romantic gestures from partners, or at least from the greeting card aisle at the store. </p>
