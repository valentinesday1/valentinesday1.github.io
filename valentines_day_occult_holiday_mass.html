        <h2><strong>valentines day occult holiday mass homemade valentines day cake</strong></h2>
        <p>Lupercalia was an ancient pagan festival held each year in Rome on February 15. Although Valentine’s Day shares its name with a martyred Christian saint, some historians believe the holiday is  
The Catholic Church later established St. Valentine's Day after two individuals named Valentine were executed on Feb. 14. This was used as a way to push out pagan rituals which were seen as offensive to the Church. Pope Gelasius I overrode the original ritual, but still held onto the concept of fertility and love. 
Here's how it started Valentine's Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty. But the ancient Romans had bloodier, drunker and more naked notions to mark the occasion. 
The holiday’s origins likely predate the venerated saint. The date of St. Valentine’s execution, the day after the February full moon, might be the real connection with affection. As fans of Shakespeare know, the Idus or “Ides” of each month on the ancient Roman calendar was the day of the full moon. 
The history of Valentine's Day: From its pagan origins to a billion-dollar holiday  in the U.S. to sell mass-produced valentines made with elaborate lace, ribbons and colorful pictures known as  
Valentine's Day as a Commercial Holiday . Valentine's Day is no longer part of the official liturgical calendar of any Christian church; it was dropped from the Catholic calendar in 1969. Its not a feast, a celebration, or a memorial of any martyrs. 
It’s often speculated that Valentine’s Day has its roots in the ancient Roman festival of Lupercalia, and it’s not hard to see why. Lupercalia was observed on February 15, and involved fertility rituals — albeit along with animal sacrifice and ritual whipping. Yet the link between this pagan festival and the Christian feast day that morphed into our modern ode to love and romance is  
The theme of love running free and wild is another facet of this wonderful holiday-and deity: our own, inner wilderness being allowed to roam free. Valentine’s Day is the Modern equivalent of Lupercalia, even though much of the symbolism of the former has been lost over time, subsumed into the latter’s imagery of hearts, red, white and pink. 
From seemingly nowhere in late 14th century England, St. Valentine’s Day became associated with romantic love. Geoffrey Chaucer’s Parliament of Fowls (1381 or 1382) seems to be the first work in which St. Valentine suddenly become associated with springtime coupling of birds. Written probably to celebrate the contracted marriage of King  
According to Kelly, author of “Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine,” the English writer was the first to make the connection to love — but he was talking about another St. Valentine

While some believe that Valentine’s Day is celebrated in the middle of February to commemorate the anniversary of Valentine’s death or burial-which probably occurred around A.D. 270, others claim that Christian church may have decided to place St. Valentine’s feast day in the middle of February in an effort to “Christianize” the pagan

The exact history of Valentine's Day is a bit murky, but some historians believe the holiday is linked to Lupercalia, a pagan festival that was held annually between Feb. 13 and Feb. 15 in ancient

In 2020 Forbes reported that Valentine’s Day is a now $20 billion holiday, “a day where 145 million cards trade hands.” The giving of cards on the holiday in America originated from Esther Howland. She designed unique, pricey cards that later turned into New England Valentine Co. With that being said 
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts  
One might wonder: If the origins of Valentine's Day are tainted with pagan influences, should we then completely reject the day? While this is a valid concern, we must remember that as Christians, we are called to express God's love every day of the year and of our lives, not just on a commercially designated holiday. </p>
