        <p>Are girls supposed to get their boyfriend anything for Valentine's Day? Is the girl also supposed to get the guy something on Valentine’s Day? Do guys give their girlfriends/wives jewelry and flowers? 
Whether the guy is 'supposed to' get his girlfriend anything on Valentine's day is not universally practiced. Likewise on whether or not the girl should get her boyfriend something, though I honestly don't see why not. If girls will expect a Valentine's day gift as well as demand gender equality, it's only fair that the gift-giving goes both ways. 
valentine's day is one of the dumbest holidays. i was never a fan of giving or receiving gifts and the like in general, so i wouldn't do anything for my partner and i wouldn't want him to do anything for me and i would refuse any gift unless he absolutely insisted on giving me one and was totally fine with not getting anything back. i do the  
It’s ok. Most men don’t give a crap about Valentine’s Day. We’re usually just forced into it by corporations playing on women’s feelings by expecting the man to get them something. But I’d you can’t afford something right now but you’d like to get him something, cook him a meal, maybe sex or a bj. 
Yes, definitely you should get something for them. I wouldn't suggest lingerie though, unless you intend for him to wear it. The day I as a guy do all the work for a celebration is my wife's birthday. And she in turn does all the work for my birthday. But Valentine's Day (like anniversaries) isn't about me or her, but me and her. 
Key points. 78% of women would trade Valentine's gifts for permission to be their real selves. Couples that embrace imperfection report stronger and more meaningful relationships. 
I was wondering what girls usually get their boyfriends for Valentine's day?? This is mine (24F) and my boyfriends (25M) first valentine's day together, we don't have anything specific planned because sadly we're both broke but I know we're gonna do something still. I do wanna do something cute and get him something, but I don't even know what. 
It's almost Valentine's day and many people get gifts, flowers, chocolate or other things like that. Here at Ask Lucas we do things a little different. Arm the animals! Start a revolution! That  
Another key aspect of Valentine's Day gifts is the packaging and presentation. Putting extra thought into the packaging and presentation of the gift can make it more special and meaningful. 
Valentine's Day is celebrated worldwide, but not in the same way everywhere.  On February 14, girls give gifts to boys. Then, on March 14, known as White Day, boys return gifts that the girls  
Idk if im supossed to get my bf something for valentines day. I dont wanna seem cheap or anything, but im only 15, but this is the first time ive had a relationship around valentines day/christmas. i was fine on christmas, but now i dont know what to

Can a girl ask a boy to be her valentine? Is it traditional and cute to ask a girl to be your valentine? Is the girl also supposed to get the guy something on Valentine’s Day? Guys, how do you think I should ask my crush to be my Valentine? Should a girl get her boyfriend something for Valentine's day even if she thinks that her

White day – March 14th. So, girls do something on Valentines day, and guys do something in return on White day – 14th of March. History of White day “White day” was also built up on Commercial purposes. In 1977, Japanese sweet company “Ishimura Manseido” started “marshmallow day” in return to Valentine’s day. 
Unfortunately, our society has told us that Valentine’s Day is the holiday to shower the “her” in the relationship with the right Valentine’s Day gift and attention for many years. It is common for the media to tell guys to spoil “her” and go all out on Valentine’s Day to show their love to “her.” 
Let’s reclaim Valentine’s Day as a celebration of pure, simple love—the kind that shows up in sticky fingers, glitter-covered tables, and hearts that might look more like squares. The most meaningful gift we can give our kids isn’t something we’ll find while scrolling through Amazon or wandering the dollar section at Target. 
I'm pretty sure that if she's hanging with you so close to valentine's day she must at least be considering the potential for a relationship as well. In this case I'd say a small gesture from the candy isle at CVS is good. If I was not at all interested in taking it further with a guy I certainly would not hang with him so close to valentine's day. 
Check out the most interesting ones of the day. Questions. Share your opinions on the questions. 
According to the ScienceOfRelationships.com survey (learn more about this survey here), it turns out that most people think both members of the couple (in heterosexual couples) should plan the Valentine’s Day festivities (70%). If only one partner does the planning, most believe it’s the man’s job (27%), with very few people believing it  </p>
