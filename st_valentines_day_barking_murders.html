        <p>Initially police believed the pair might still be alive – but as time went on they began to fear the men, who were last seen in Gascoigne Road’s Hope Pub on Valentine’s Day, 1984, had been killed. 
At 10:30 in the morning on Saint Valentine's Day, Thursday, February 14, 1929, seven men were murdered at the garage at 2122 North Clark Street, [2][3] in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago's North Side. They were shot by four men using weapons that included two Thompson submachine guns. 
THE COLDEST CASE: Since February 14, 1929, when seven men were gunned down inside a Clark Street garage, the mastermind behind the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre has remained a mystery, though 
As the culmination of a gang war between famous rivals Al ‘Scarface’ Capone and George ‘Bugs’ Moran, the bloody events of the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre were splashed across the world’s media and came to symbolise the violence of the prohibition era in Chicago. 
On the morning of February 14, 1929, five members of Chicago's notorious South Side Gang (accompanied by two associates) were coerced into meeting an unknown source at their bootlegging garage to apparently get their hands on a lucrative supply of stolen whiskey. 
Valentine's Day 1929 marks the most infamous gangster mass murder in history, when mobsters Al Capone, "Bugs" Moran, and others fought for their share of the profits from illegal activity 
It was painfully cold on Valentine’s Day morning at 2212 N. Clark St. Seven members of the North Side Gang had arrived early to broker a deal with Detroit’s Purple Gang for cheap whiskey. It was supposed to be eight men, but gang leader Moran had woken up late and was running behind. 
As Troy Taylor's historical essay "Blood, Roses and Valentines" recalls, the events that led up to the massacre started in 1924 with murder of gang leader Dion O'Banion, who was the chief competition to Chicago Outfit leader Johnny Torrio in the bootleg liquor business. O'Banion controlled the North Side operation, Torrio the South Side. 
Ninety two years ago, one of the most infamous massacres in United States history took place on 14th February. Remembered as the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, seven mafia men were murdered on 
The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre marked a critical point in the Beer Wars, a years-long conflict between Chicago’s gangs who were battling for control of the bootlegging market and organized crime during Prohibition. 
On St. Valentine's Day, most of the Moran gang had already arrived at the warehouse by approximately 10:30 AM. Moran was not there, having left his Parkway Hotel apartment late. As Moran and one of his men, Ted Newberry, approached the rear of the warehouse from a side street they saw the police car pull up. 
Do only fuzzy romantic feelings come to mind when you think of Valentine's Day? How about if we call it St. Valentine's Day? This is the story of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre at a Lincoln Park  
One of the venerable ghost stories of Chicago concerns the one survivor of the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre: Highball the dog, who was tied to one of the axles of the trucks in the garage. Some say it was his hysterical barking that brought the attention of the neighbors to the garage after seven guys affiliated (in one way or another) with  
It was here, on Valentine’s Day 1929, that the most spectacular mob hit in gangland history took place the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. The bloody events of February 14, 1929 began nearly five years before with the murder of Dion O’Banion, the leader of Chicago’s north side mob. 
On the morning of February 14, 1929 four unknown assailants, two dressed as Chicago policemen, gunned down seven men in a Lincoln Park neighborhood garage. This crime shocked the nation and had long-term effects on local and national law enforcement and politics. Officially, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre is an unsolved crime. 
These seven people took that whole "love" thing really, really, seriously. This is a list of murders committed on Valentine's Day that made the news in recent memory. What are some of the most brutal Valentine's Day murders? Well, this list will give that answer along with the grizzly details affiliated with the incident in question.
