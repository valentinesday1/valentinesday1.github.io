Whilst Valentine’s Day is named after Saint Valentine, a priest who lived during the third century, the day does not have its roots in Christian tradition but rather in paganism. Many historians believe the day originated from the Roman pagan festival of fertility called Lupercalia , which was held on 15th February every year. 
Valentine’s Day is a holiday celebrated every February 14; this year Valentine's Day falls on a Friday. Across the United States and in other places around the world, candy, flowers and gifts

Aside from Christmas (already gone), and St. Valentine’s (on its way out, see below). MLK Day is the only holiday named after a person — a male and a religious preacher at that. Since we have  
A highly insulted Claudius arrested Valentine and sentenced him to death. After the ingenious tortures of the Roman imperium, Valentine succumbed to death on February 14, 269 AD.

Valentine’s Day is the holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It may have had beginnings in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, which celebrated the coming of spring and included fertility rites and other activities, but the origin of the holiday is vague at best.
