        <p>Since it was a success I saved it to another slot just in case. But so how would that work with the holiday? And could I salvage it somehow and end up going on a date with him or does it need to be 
“The Valentine and White Days have special effects on the friendship points: Giving cookies to a marriage candidate will gain +15 FP, while receiving them will gain +5 FP. Asking them to come to the castle by selecting "Call to the Castle." from the "BTW" dialogue will gain extra +15 FP on top of giving the cookie. 
I'm on my first Valentine's Day (Fall 11th or something?) and I'm halfway through with the 2nd plotline. Not sure if that means anything or helps. 
Valentine's Day in Rune Factory 4 falls on 12 Autumn when your Character is a Girl. All the female Characters should give you Cookies. You can return them if you like or you can give them Cookies that are 'Original', in other words, made by you. 
It's the day before Valentine's Day and I was told by the villagers that I need to ask a girl out and give cookies. Cookies are not a problem, but I can't seem to ask a girl out. Do you 
If you feel like people aren't where they're supposed to be try two things: Take them into your team and then release them. This will cause the system to reboot the position of the character. Save and restart the system. This has the same effect. Doesn't work for all cases but helps me out in most of them. Good to know for future reference. Thanks. 
Volkanon told me that on this day the ladies give the men cookies and stuff. But he didn't mention anything about the guys. Do I need to give them anything back? In HM, on Valentine's you 
So just did Valentine's Day and I'm dating Dylas. We met up at the appropriate time and place and I gave him his cookie. Instead of the usual green (I believe) colored numbers that indicate FP/LP growth, they were red. 
Festivals from Rune Factory 4. All festivals run from 11:00 to 18:00, with some happening at whatever point you initiate them, and others going the entire time as you try to accomplish a given task. Festivals that involve taking the player's spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend place most dates at 19:00. 
So I finally got best boy Murakumo as my partner, and my character and him went on their first date on Valentines day. The problem is, I can't give him his cookie, as it says "We're going on a date later today, why don't I save the surprise until then?" 
This is a guide to Valentine&amp;#39;s Day, a Festival held on Autumn 12 in Rune Factory 5. Learn what you can do on Valentine&amp;#39;s Day, as well as how to give and receive cookies! 
Functionally speaking, when you boil it down to its most simple form, Valentines Day is when women give the chocolate, and White Day is when the men do. So same-sex relationships wouldn't really change that dynamic in Rune Factory, you'd think. But I did notice myself that the guys gave me chocolate on Valentines too. 
Ahem. This game works like it works in japan, in other words boys get chocolate (or in this game cookies for whatever reason) in valentines day meaning you are supposed give cookies to the boys if you are playing as Frey in valentines day, you can also give them to the girls if you want some fun with the dialogue.

Despite the old tradition of girls giving out cookies on Valentine's Day and guys giving out cookies on White Day, most couples shared cookies on both days. It made it easier and some couples didn't have the correct amount of ingredients by Autumn 12th.
