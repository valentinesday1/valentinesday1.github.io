        <h2><strong>valentines day 1890 carry out valentines day</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day had already gained popularity with American school children by the early 1880s, and many of the traditions from the time we still hold true today. By then, school children were in the practice of gifting classmates with homemade tissue paper hearts accented with doilies and ribbon or with cards adorned with glued scrap-paper  
Turn of the 19th Century Valentine’s Day Trends. An 1899 Valentine’s Day trend was to send a valentine with a small object attached. One such Valentine’s Day card had an artificial violet and featured this poem: Roses are red, violets are blue; Sugar is sweet and so are you.

In the early part of the 20th century, Valentine’s Day humor began to shift away from insulting Vinegar Valentines and moved toward bad puns of all sorts. This example from a set of 12 postcards reveal that fruits and vegetables could be enlisted as the subject matter for valentines, as long as they were accompanied by a pun-inspired inscription. 
Valentine's Day evolved significantly during the Industrial Revolution, transitioning from handmade to mass-produced greeting cards. By the 1850s, manufactured cards dominated, with over a million  
Where did Valentine’s Day originate? For years, the consensus among historians was that the holiday had something to do with an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia that fell in mid-February. Noel Lenski, a Yale University historian, pointed to the seasonal and thematic connections between Lupercalia and modern Valentine’s Day. 
Since 2000 and the rise of the internet, more and more people celebrate Valentine’s Day digitally with e-cards, with around 15 million e-Valentine’s Day cards sent in 2010. While it has its roots in Christianity, Valentine’s Day is considered a ‘Hallmark holiday’ by many people today because of its commercialisation, and the focus on

During the month of February, the shelves of most retail spaces overflow with red roses, chubby cherubim, and arrowed hearts—unmistakable symbols of Valentine’s Day. Far from a twentieth-century “Hallmark holiday” invention, Valentine’s Day and the exchange of sentimental cards and tokens has a long history. 
ments that what made the celebration of St. Valentine’s Day a fashion in New York, Philadelphia, and an ever-widening circle of places were valentines.6 There seems to be little doubt that the valentine card craze began in England and later developed in this country.
