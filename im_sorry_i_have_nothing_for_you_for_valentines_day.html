        <p>Tell your partner that you enjoy celebrating Valentine's Day and were hoping for a gift. Suggest the possibility of an alternative "Valentine's Day" just for the two of you. Be sure to use "I-statements" while discussing the subject. I-statements usually begin with "I feel" and go on to explain your emotions. 
72. Sending you a big Valentine’s Day hug. 73. Happy Valentine’s Day to one of our sweetest blessings. 74. U R 2 cute! 75. Hope your day is filled with fun and your mouth is filled with  
“Happy Valentine’s Day. You bring so much joy into my life in many different ways that I’d need hours to tell you about it. Let’s get dinner soon so I can. I love you.” “Happy Valentine’s Day. You have the biggest heart and the best laugh.” “Happy Valentine’s Day. 
Every day with you feels like Valentine’s Day. I’m so lucky to have you. You’re not just my husband—you’re my best friend and the love of my life. Thank you for bringing so much love, joy, and adventure into my life. I love you. Through all the seasons, through all of time I love you. Happy Valentine's Day. Thank you for being my  
If you need an extra Valentine this year, I'm happy to volunteer as tribute. No need to ask me to be your Valentine. I already asked for you and the answer is yes. I'd share my chocolates with you. Kiss me like it's Valentine's Day, 1999. You stole my heart. So I'm stealing your chocolate. I'm staring at you while you read this card. 
Happy Valentine's Day. I'm so happy to have found someone as weird as me. I love every little freckle on your face. The kids are so lucky to have you. Happy Valentine's Day, my parent-in-crime. I promise to always make you proud that you swiped right. Mornings are so much better now you’re here. The best thing you've taught me is how to love  
130.) Every day is Valentine’s Day when I’m with you. 131.) With a woman like you in my life, I really am the luckiest man in the world. For your Wife or Girlfriend. 132.) A message for my Sweetheart. Every day with you is Valentine’s Day for me. I Love you. 133.) A woman who is as lovely as you should be told how amazing she is every day. 
42. I'm whey into you. 43. You make my heart race. 44. Life means squat without you. 45. The first time I saw you, it was love at first set. 46. When I'm with you, my heart beats faster than in a  
I love you more than you’ll ever know. Happy Valentine’s Day! I would choose you again and again. Happy Valentine’s Day to the woman of my dreams. You’re the reason I am who I am today. Thank you for everything you do for our family. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love! You are my best friend, my partner, and my soulmate. I love you. 
I'm still falling for you every single day. Happy Valentine's Day! Here's to another Valentine's Day spent with the love of my life—and to many more. I can't wait for forever with you. You're the reason I am who I am today. Thank you for everything you do. I love you so much! Again and again, I would choose you. Happy Valentine’s Day. 
Hubby and I each have a budget of $10 for Valentine's Day. It means we have to get creative and really think about how to say I love you. Being vegan adds to the challenge. But we have been married for 26 years so we must be doing something right. 
As an example: If my way to offer and receive affection for my special someone is through sharing quality time with them and they just blow me off on Valentine's Day, I'd probably feel hurt too, unless we'd both discussed it and decided that Valentine's day didn't really hold any significance for us. 
I’m in a similar situation my partner of 4 years did absolutely nothing for me yesterday (Valentine’s day) and I made it clear that I was upset and every time that he asked me what was wrong I clearly told him that I was upset that for the second year in a row he did absolutely nothing for Valentine’s Day. 
That was me until I was 27. I met my wife the Valentine’s Day after. We have a lovely daughter and a baby boy in his way (any day now!). Valentine’s Day doesn’t mean anything, hun. Don’t get caught up in the Hallmark holidays 
I (f22) have been dating my boyfriend (m24) for two years. We've celebrated valentines day before by gifting eachother cutesie things but yesterday I received nothing. I don't really care about money being spent on me, he could've written me a letter or gifted me a cute rock for all I care. 
Not a holiday like Valentine's day. It's too specific to one person in your life. Most holidays aren't like that. Plus you could unintentionally make the person feel BAD about not having anyone to celebrate that day with. 
By sending a Valentine’s day message you are letting them know how great they truly are! Wishing you a day filled with love and neighborly cheer. Happy Valentine’s Day to the fantastic neighbor that you are. Happy Valentine’s Day! Grateful to have such an amazing neighbor. Here’s to the shared moments that make our community feel like a  
"I'm sorry I gave you a homemade coupon book  gift card as a form of apology for forgetting Valentine's Day, I would have gone.  was Valentine's Day. And bought you absolutely nothing! 7. 
Valentine’s Day Messages; Missing You Valentine’s Day Quotes; Missing You Valentine’s Day Quotes. Sometimes we must be apart from the loves of our lives. But, sending them missing you Valentine messages no matter how far apart you may be will let them know you are thinking about them and that you care for them. 
Should have ONLY done it because you wanted to. You shouldn’t spend the last of your money on a joke of a holiday. The end of the day you got upset over thing you built up in your head. For Valentine’s Day my wife and I spam each other with the cheesiest and most messed up valentines memes we can find. That’s it. That’s all. </p>
