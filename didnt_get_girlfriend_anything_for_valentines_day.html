        <h2><strong>didnt get girlfriend anything for valentines day valentines day dinner specials in minneapolis</strong></h2>
        <p>Valentine's Day is an odd holiday: for some people, it's super important, but for others, it's not especially significant. If you've been dating for 2 months, it's possible you both misunderstood each other's expectations for the day. It's totally valid to care about Valentine's Day and to be hurt that he didn't get you anything. 
At the end of the day, what truly matters is the connection and love you share with your partner. Valentine's Day is just one day on the calendar, and a gift, or the lack thereof, shouldn't define your relationship. The most valuable thing is the time and effort you both invest in maintaining a strong and loving bond. 
It’s best to give this guy a nice breakup as a Valentine’s Day gift. My Husband Didn’t Get Me Anything For Valentine’s Day. We are not talking about some random boyfriend here; we are talking about your husband here. You expected a nice Valentine’s Day gift from him but didn’t get it. Maybe this is the reason: 1. 
I’m not high maintenance, the smallest things mean the world to me. I am the more masculine one in the relationship and she does tend to treat me more like a man, where she doesn’t give me much reassurance, no valentine’s day gift, makes me come see her, etc. 
If your new partner doesn’t want to do something special for Valentine’s Day and you do, this suggests he’s just not that into you, or may signal important information about clashing values. Valentine’s Day, like many holidays, often tap into traditions and messages you’ve internalized since early childhood. 
My point is, most men generally only do anything on Valentine’s Day for one of two reasons: 1) they don’t feel like getting b1tched at for ‘not caring,’ or 2) they think they’ll get laid  
I totally get that, but she is and she is always very excited about even our month-adversaries. She was hyping up that she was excited about Valentine’s Day yet didn’t put in any effort. If she didn’t have to pay for anything if she didn’t want to, but if so she wouldn’t have said that she she would cook dinner (her plan, not mine). 
Common Reasons a Boyfriend Might Not Give a Valentine’s Gift He May Not Subscribe to the Idea of Valentine’s Day. Many people despise Valentine’s Day because it is a “Hallmark Holiday.” This refers to holidays that no longer celebrate their original meaning and now only exist to sell holiday cards and gifts. 
Of course, it could be worse. Your partner could acknowledge Valentine’s Day but give you a gift that suggests they secretly hate you. We once asked our readers about the worst V-Day gifts they’d received, and we received those kinds of example: an unsigned Hallmark card, a one-year paid membership to a gym, “a Bible and a lecture about how I had been dressing ‘inappropriately’ by  
Q: Your partner does sweet and thoughtful things for you throughout the year but doesn’t plan anything special for Valentine’s Day. You’re upset. 
The only thing that bothers me is she didn’t do anything for me. At all. I didn’t want anything fancy. But a $2 card, a massage, maybe some special lingerie for the bedroom, just one of those would have made my night. She didn’t even do the one thing she had agreed to beforehand, she was supposed to handle dessert. 
Valetines day I made a discord bot that would send her reasons I love her every day for 3 months. She got me nothing for any of those events. She did get me something for my birthday before we started dating and she drew me something for Christmas (so did I). How do I tell her that I'm kinda upset she didnt get me anything without sounding too  
My girlfriend didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day So we are in a long distance relationship because we attend different universities, but Valentine’s Day came around and I sent her a nice little care package with a card and some other things. 
4 years ago when me and my gf were friends she didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day but I gave her a bouquet in the form of Twix candies because that’s her favorite. Now I understand why she didn’t give me anything because we were not dating and we were just friends. 
Tell him exactly your feelings about how sad you felt because you didn't get anything for Valentine's. If he loves you, he will feel like crap and make it to you, even if it's a little late. Maybe (maybe, that's all) he feels Valentine's it's a little phony, with all the crap they are selling 
Ummm I didn't, but both of us made it clear that we're not buying each other anything until we actually meet. Anyway, I don't expect him to give me anything for valentine's day even that I did make and give him a digital valentine's day card in which he didn't say much for that either 😝 
I was always triggered around Valentine’s Day when they didn’t plan or get me anything. I realize it’s a dumb holiday but when they made zero effort the other 364 days, you hope that maybe on Valentine’s Day, when there are boxes of chocolate or bouquets of flowers front and center at every grocery store, they’ll do SOMETHING. 
My (19) boyfriend (21) didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day I’m not sure if I’m taking this too deep but I got my boyfriend of 8 months a couple of things for Valentine’s Day, some chocolate, a necklace and made him a card. 
First off, take a deep breath and don't jump to conclusions. It's easy to feel a bit bummed or even overlooked if you were expecting a little something and it didn't happen, especially on a day like Valentine's Day, which is all about expressing affection. 
This is our second valentines and last year he did. I made him something and it ain't much but it took me a few hours. I gave it to him this morning and he seemed to like it and said we have to go to Walmart to get u something. </p>
