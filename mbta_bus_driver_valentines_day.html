        <p>With Valentine’s Day right around the corner, TransitMatters encourages riders to show their appreciation for transit workers by giving Valentine’s Day cards to frontline transit workers on February 14! To make it easier for riders to get involved, we designed the valentines for them.

Transit Driver Appreciation Day Each year, March 18 marks Transit Driver Appreciation Day. This date was selected to commemorate the first “Five Penny Coaches” bus line established in Paris in 1662. On this day, we celebrate public transit vehicle operators around the world and recognize the essential service they provide. 
When the MBTA launched a Valentine’s Day contest that asked riders to share videos expressing the reasons they love a particular bus stop, train station or neighborhood, some customers wondered  
March is Transit Driver Appreciation Month recognizing the 2,500 drivers and operators who help power the MBTA.

"Those people have a tough job  
Then the driver went over the intercom and said "thank you". Some drivers just don't give a fuck. One time I was waiting for a bus and it never showed up. Since the stop was a beginning stop the next bus driver showed up early and waited and when he saw all of us he got pissed off at the other bus driver ON OUR BEHALF. 
Back in the day, my Dad used to give his bus drivers a bottle of booze. I always questioned giving a professional driver alcochol but it seemed to work for them. I usually have done a Christmas card with a Dunkin gift card and a scratch off. 
This type of schedule means you can be assigned any other persons schedule, run extra service on heavy bus routes, assist a bus that's broken down. Everyone is entitled to a 20 minute break bus some schedules give you more 
All MBTA buses are accessible, and riders can read the bus access guide for more information. On the weekend of April 19-20, bus service will be adjusted to meet the demands of Patriots' Day weekend.

In preparation for the computer-based commercial learner's permit (CLP) exam, you will start your bus operator training with a paid, two-week CDL course. The course is taught by an MBTA instructor, Monday – Friday, 6 AM – 2PM. 2. Study for and Take the CLP Exam. The CLP exam, paid for by the MBTA, consists of three sections: 
62K per year to drive a MBTA bus is probably still not enough to deal with what bus drivers go through every day. They should give hazard pay for the areas nobody wants to work. Reply reply

The technology allows a bus approaching a green light to ping the traffic signal to hold the light just a bit longer — akin to calling ahead for someone to keep an elevator door open.

There were reports that the bus had been stolen, but the MBTA later confirmed that the driver was employed by the transit agency, and that the vehicle had been taken from an MBTA garage in Boston. 
Friend works for them in their Power Department. Was telling me to apply as a bus driver. There is a sign-on bonus right now. He said it was $5k. Apparently they need bus drivers and operators pretty bad. He enjoys the work but says the shifts for his department and the shifts for the drivers and operators aren’t always great for a social life. 
The MBTA is an excellent place to work. The benefits and pay are terrific. In the transportation department for example bus driving train driver green line driver Blue Line Orange Line Etc working with the public is required. Working for the MBTA is an excellent opportunity. You can make a career out of it and raise a family buy a house and so on. </p>
